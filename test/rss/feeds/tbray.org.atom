<p>In my position I probably shouldn’t have a favorite AWS product, just like you shouldn’t have a favorite child. I
do have a fave service but fortunately I’m not an (even partial) parent; so let’s hope that’s OK.  I’m talking about
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">Amazon Simple Queue Service</a>, which nobody ever calls by its full name.</p>
<p>I’d been thinking I should write on the subject, then saw a Twitter thread from
<a href="http://rickbranson.com/">Rick Branson</a> (trust me, don’t follow that link) which begins
<a href="https://twitter.com/rbranson/status/1131989746643742721">Queues are bad, but software developers love them. You’d
think they would magically fix any overload or failure problem. But they don’t, and bring with them a bunch of their own
problems.</a> After that I couldn’t not write about queueing in general and SQS specifically.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/26/SQS-banner.png" alt="SQS banner" />
<h2 id='p-1'>SQS is nearly perfect</h2>
<p>The perfect Web Service I mean: There are no capacity reservations! You can make as many queues as you want to,
you can send as many messages as you want to, you can pull them off fast or slow depending how many readers you have. You can even
just ignore them; there are people who’ll dump a few million messages onto a queue and almost never retrieve them, except when
something goes terribly wrong and they need to recover their state.  Those messages will age out and vanish after a little while (14
days is currently the max); but before they go, they’re stored carefully and are very unlikely to go missing.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t see hosts so you don’t have to worry about picking, configuring, or patching them. Win!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of technologies we couldn’t run at all without SQS, ranging from
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>  to modern Serverless stuff.</p>
<p>The API is the simplest thing imaginable: Send Messages, Receive Messages, Delete Messages.  I love things that do one thing simply,
quickly, and well.  I can’t give away details, but there are <em>lots</em> of digits in the number of messages/second SQS handles on
busy days. I can’t give away architectures, but the way the front-end and back-end work together to store messages quickly and
reliably is drop-dead cool.</p>
<p>Why not entirely perfect?  Well, SQS
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_simple_q/">launched in 2006</a>. Most parts of the service have been re-implemented
at least once, but some moss has grown over the years. I sit next to the SQS team and know the big picture reasonably well, and I
think we can make SQS cheaper and simpler to operate.</p>
<p>When it launched it cost 10¢ per thousand messages; now it’s 40¢ per million
API calls. “Per-message” can be a bit tricky to work out because
sending, receiving, and deleting makes three calls per, but then SQS helps you batch and most high-volume apps do.
Anyhow, it’s absurdly cheaper than back then,
and I wonder whether, in a few years, that 40¢/million number will look as high as 10¢/thousand does today.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The opposition</h2>
<p>So let’s go back to Mr Branson’s
<a href="https://twitter.com/rbranson/status/1131989746643742721">tweet-rant</a>.  He raises a bunch of objections to queues which
I’ll try to summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>They can mask downstream failures</p></li>
<li><p>They don’t necessarily preserve ordering (SQS doesn’t).</p></li>
<li><p>When they <em>are</em> ordered, you probably need to shard to lots of different streams and keep track of the shard
readers.</p></li>
<li><p>They’re hard to capacity plan; it’s easy to fill up RAM and disks.</p></li>
<li><p>They don’t exert back-pressure against clients that are overrunning your system.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s his conclusion.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/26/anti-queue.png" alt="Anti-queue closer from Rick Branson" />
<p>While there <em>are</em> good queues, I agree with his sentiment.
If you can build a straightforward monolithic app and never think about all this
asynchronous crap, go for it! If your system is big enough that you need to refactor into microservices for sanity’s sake, but you
can get away with synchronous call chains, you definitely should.</p>
<p>But if you have software components that need to be hooked together, and sometimes the upstream runs faster than the
downstream can handle, or you need to scale components independently to manage load, or you need to make temporary outages
survivable by stashing traffic-in-transit, well… a queue becomes “absolutely necessary”.</p>
<p>The proportion of services I work on where queues are absolutely necessary rounds to 100%. And if you look at our customers, lots
of them manage to get away without queues (good for them!) but a really huge number totally depend on them. And I don’t think that’s
because the customers are stupid.</p>
<p>Mr Branson’s charges are accurate descriptions of queuing semantics; but what he sees as shortcomings, people who use queues see
as features. Yeah, they mask
errors and don’t exert back-pressure. So, suppose you have a retail website named after a river in Brazil, and you have
fulfillment centers that deliver the stuff the website sells. You <em>really</em> want to protect the website from
fulfillment-center errors and throttling. You want to <em>know</em> about those errors and throttling, and a well-designed messaging
system should
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html">make that
easy</a>. Yeah, it can be a pain in the butt to capacity-plan a queue<span class='dashes'> —</span> ask anyone
who runs their own. That’s why your local public-cloud provider offers them as a managed service.  Yeah, some applications need ordering,
so there are queuing services that offer it. Yeah, ordering often implies sharding, and so your ordered-queue service should provide
<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client">a library to help with that</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>But wait, there’s more!</h2>
<p>More kinds of queues, I mean. AWS has
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/messaging/">six different ones</a>. Actually, that page hasn’t been updated since we
launched
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/">Managed Streaming for Kafka</a>, so I guess we have seven now.</p>
<p>We actually did a Twitch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukdGHdjmr6oq4S3RzCJKVj_t">video lecture series</a> to help people sort out
which of these might hit their sweet spot.</p>
<p>With a whole bunch of heroic work, we might be able to cram together all these services into a smaller number of packages,
but I’d be astonished if that were a cost-effective piece of engineering.</p>
<p>So with respect, I have to disagree with Mr Branson. I’d go so far as to say that if you’re building a moderately complex piece
of software that needs to integrate heterogeneous microservices and deal with variable sometimes-high request loads, then if your
design doesn’t have a queuing component, quite possibly you’re Doing It Wrong.</p>

<p>Really, they are. Our civic spaces are mis-led and full of anger, some of it even righteous.
We have fouled our species’ nest and are ignoring the smoke curling out of its
edges, and don’t know what’s awaiting when we fall out of the tree.  I’ve been sad a lot.</p>
<p>For days at a time, even.  I get up and find myself barking at my children for the smallest sins; just a shitty mood that I can’t
shake.  Introspecting, I see that I enjoy my job and get along with my family and am loved enough and have enough others
to love.  I like my car and my bike and my city and my garden.  And eventually I had to admit that it was the lousy state of the
world dragging me down.</p>
<p>What to do about it?  You can’t and anyway shouldn’t face away from the world.  We need to keep finding
the courage to face the truth and work on mending what’s broken. Because in my heart and my mind I actually really don’t believe
this is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>; we are not (quoting Tolkien’s Galadriel) “fighting the long
defeat”. There are paths to better places and whether or not the pain and injustice and filth are our fault, finding those paths is our
responsibility.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gubeikou</h2>
<p>Or 古北口<span class='dashes'> —</span> it’s a town northeast of Beijing on a not-particularly great section of the Great Wall.
It has a temple for the Goddess of Mercy.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190328_163053.png" alt="Temple of the Goddess of Mercy, Gubeikou" />
<p>The temple is well-maintained and the offerings fresh. That’s a no-brainer<span class='dashes'> —</span> would you prefer a just
or a merciful deity?</p>
<p>Why am I sharing this? Just a reminder that the world, uglified though it may be this year, contains wonders; the hope is
to lighten a rotten mood if only my own.  What we are trying to save is worth saving! See those paintings on the Goddess’
wall? They were said to represent her attendants and are worth a look.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190328_164057.png" alt="On the wall of the temple of the Goddess of Mercy, Gubeikou" />
<h2 id='p-2'>That said…</h2>
<p>In another part of the world, the country next to mine, sixty-five million people think Donald Trump is just fine and will
probably think so again in 2020.  In my own country, a morally-hollowed-out leadership is probably about to punch a bitumen pipeline
through the walls of sanity to the Pacific to increase our share of carbon loading even as the carbon numbers attain levels never
seen in our (or any) civilization. I could enumerate bad crazinesses in lots more timezones, but why? Anyone who troubles to find
out knows.</p>
<p>I find it hard to deal with the fact that, and I’m phrasing this as gently as I can manage, a substantial
proportion of the population seem ignorant, bigoted, and mean.  Perhaps the natural proportion of Deplorables has been made larger by
dysfunctional media. I’d like to believe that because media are fixable but endemic mean-spiritedness isn’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Horrorshow</h2>
<p>In Hong Kong, lining up for the Star Ferry across the harbor, among more tourists than locals since they put in the subway
tunnel, I came face-to-face with it. In a party of otherwise-unexceptionable Americans, there was the #MAGAhead with That Hat,
waddling, empty-eyed, enormously obese; folds of fat hanging out of the bottom of his golf shorts.
In the warm wet Chinese air I
couldn’t dig up a sane way to react or even a sane thing to say because, frankly, murder was uncoiling at the back of my brain.
Fortunately for that dude, I’m a grown-up.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>More temple walls</h2>
<p>The ones without paintings are a canvas for nature to write on.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/XT300621.png" alt="Shadows on a Chinese temple wall" />
<p>Across the Pacific, nature writes in big letters. Here, from left to right, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_fir">Douglas Fir</a>, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_plicata">Western Redcedar</a>, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuga_heterophylla">Western Hemlock</a>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190420_104157.png" alt="Trees on Keats Island in Howe Sound" />
<p>Get out of their way, leave them the fuck alone, and they’ll do fine. In my heart I believe that if I could learn to listen slowly
enough, they’d have things to say that we’d benefit from hearing.
We need to do more getting out of the way.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'><i>The Second Coming</i></h2>
<p>It’s really the biggest threat. I’m talking about these lines from
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">Yeats’ poem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>
Are full of passionate intensity.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s so easy to say “Screw it, what can I do?” and change the channel.
Let’s not. Let’s drink beers and sing songs and share pictures and sign petitions and get
arrested where it might matter; Let’s bathe shameless in our world’s good things but never say “Screw it”, because those good
things are worth, at the end of the day, dying for.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/17/IMG_20190517_081623.png" alt="Wet poppy flowers" />
<p>Our times are kind of particularly fucked up just now. I’d like to wear that fact like the poppies wear the raindrops. They’re tough
generalists and will probably outlive <i>Homo sapiens</i> for a while, whatever dumb-ass things we do. But let’s try to stick
around and keep them company.</p>

<p>Yesterday I drove the I-Pace to Seattle and back in one day, 459.8km (285.7 miles); the second time I’ve done that. What with that, and
coming up for four months ownership, I thought it was time for another, maybe the final, instalment in
<a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">this diary</a>.  Mostly good news<span class='dashes'> —</span> by a wide margin
the best car I’ve ever driven let alone owned<span class='dashes'> —</span> but nothing’s perfect.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Range</h2>
<p>That’s still the biggest talking point about electric cars.  But up here in the Pacific Northwest anyhow, the charging network is
pretty well good enough and getting better.  If I’m staying overnight in Seattle I use the Level 2 chargers in the Amazon buildings.
But on  single-day round-trips you need more watts.  On both of those trips I used
<a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a> to find fast DC chargers, and both were by
<a href="https://www.evgo.com/">EVgo</a>. I really have no gripes, their gear seems to Just Work.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190415_110621.png" alt="Charging the I-Pace" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190508_104257.png" alt="Fast DC charger readout" />
<p>The charger above is in Lynnwood, a suburb just north of Seattle. Amusingly, all the EVgo chargers have names, which actually
help you to figure out which is which when they’re in a cluster. That’s “Elijah” in Lynnwood.</p>
<p>The screenshot is from one of the chargers (“Ceres” and “Millie”) at the
<a href="https://www.rei.com/stores/seattle.html">REI flagship store</a>, which at a block off I-5 is super-handy, and also
a beautiful place to hang out and visit.  On this particular trip I got there a little
early and
charged for 28 minutes before my meetings and then another 25 after, picking up a total of 41kWh, and getting home with 30km of
battery to spare.  EVgo charged me $16.28.</p>
<p>The attentive reader will note that 117A at 415V is 48.55kW. I have yet to encounter one of the rumored-to-exist 100kW chargers,
but 53 minutes of charging for nearly six hours of driving at highway speeds across hilly terrain is bearable.  At this point
a snotty Tesla owner will point out that they have 100kW now and (for many of them) it’s free. Yeah, but your car is boring.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that those fast chargers are kind of noisy; when they’re pumping 50kW into your vehicle there are
heavy-duty mechanical sounds coming out; presumably fans?  So you probably wouldn’t want one right next to your
patio or bedroom window.</p>
<p>Since we’re talking about charging, obviously almost all of that happens at home.  We hardly ever car-commute, with just minor
puttering around town and weekend excursions, end up charging once every week or ten days.  Looking at my power bill reveals I pay
somewhere around $2.50/day when I don’t charge, and six or seven bucks when I do. Yeah, the car pulls twice as much as the rest of
the house put together.  OK, our stove and water heater are natural gas; but still.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190509_170400.png" alt="Charging the car at home" />
<p>Above is the little carport we put in because I didn’t want either the charger or the Jag out in the weather all the time. If you
look close you can see the charger just behind the car.  This is just after the return from Seattle, so the car’s a little
cruddy.</p>
<p>The home “Level 2” charger is entirely silent, but then depending on the temperature the car sometimes turns on its fans to heat
or cool the batteries while charging; not for long, though.</p>
<p>We don’t have a garage door to open, but I wired the carport light up with a
<a href="https://amzn.to/308oxai">LiftMaster 823lm</a> light switch and now I can turn it on with the garage-door control on the
car’s rearview when I’m coming home after dark. I also had to get a <a href="https://amzn.to/2vPxwj2">LiftMaster remote control</a>
so I could turn it back off from inside the house.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Good stuff</h2>
<p>You just can’t drive this puppy around without smiling.  It’s smooth, comfy, and amazingly athletic. Merging onto a big highway
is pure joy, and taking uphill curves hard will make you laugh out loud.
Even going with the flow in heavy traffic is a lot more relaxing than you’re probably used to.
When I get in any gas car now, it feels  klunky, noisy, and unresponsive.</p>
<p>You get compliments and smiles from border guards, both US and Canadian. Now <em>that</em> is a new experience.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a super-warm Spring day so now I’ve driven it in four seasons, more or less; the climate control and general
comfort is uniformly excellent, and I had my first experience of cooled seats, which feel amazingly great when you’ve been driving
for a couple of hours in the sun.</p>
<p>When I first got in the car I hated the audio, it sounded tinny and like it was coming out of the windshield. And yeah, the
default settings are lousy but they’re easy enough to fiddle; now the sound’s a warm bath of rich silky chocolate.</p>
<p>There are 3405km on the odometer (we’re pretty urban) and I haven’t had anything go wrong. Oh wait, let me amend that. Sometimes
(not very often) things will get a little weird<span class='dashes'> —</span> Android Auto won’t connect, or the radio-station list
won’t be there, or whatever. So, just like any other mobile computerized device, you pull over and you turn it off and back on
again, and generally then you’re OK. One time I had to reboot both the car <em>and</em> my phone.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Bad things</h2>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: This car’s a joybringer on any road, urban or rural or freeway, but it is a <em>complete
fucking pig</em> to park.  It’s wide, and because of the cab-forward design you totally can’t see the teeny front hood of the car at all
from behind the wheel, so how in hell are you supposed to know whether you’re properly lined up at the curb or evenly between the
lines?  All these weeks in, I can now generally do a parallel park and end up about as straight as I’d expect from a
16-year-old trainee driver.  But I often have to take two or three passes at ordinary parking-lot slots.  And as for our carport,
it isn’t any too big, and the alley it’s off of isn’t any too wide.  I have on a single-digit number of occasions backed in straight
and centered on the first try, but never when any of the neighbors or family are watching.  I didn’t order the front camera option;
maybe that was a mistake?  Anyhow, I’m sure in another year or two I’ll be drifting into the carport.</p>
<p>What else can I complain about?  Yeah, the infotainment software is a little slow and klunky.  Six months into shipping this
thing JLR still doesn’t have the software OTA working.  I’m hoping that pretty soon it’ll be like my Fujifilm cameras and
periodically get updates that add features and make things better.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/09/IMG_20190417_182918.png" alt="Magnolia I-Pace" />
<h2 id='p-4'>Just a car</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, that’s all it is. It makes me happy to drive, happy to talk about, and I’m loading the atmosphere with a
whole lot less carbon than I used to.  But a new car isn’t a life-changer. Except for now I get a few more smiles every week.</p>

<p>It’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin">chunk of China</a> west and south of Beijing, extending to the sea, with a mere
fifteen or so million or so people.  It was where our walking-the-Wall sequence ended up, specifically at 黄崖关
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangya_Pass">Huangyaguan</a>). The wall there was OK, but there was an attached museum I
really liked, and also the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Qing_tombs">Eastern Qing Tombs</a>, which are highly photogenic and full of
stories.  Here’s a view out over Huangyaguan from up on the Wall.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300527.png" alt="View from Huangyaguan Great Wall" />
<p>If you make it to Huangyaguan, don’t spend your whole time up on the wall, leave an hour or two for the Huangyaguan Great Wall
Museum, which seems not to have a Web presence. It’s big, mostly open to the sky, and serene. Of the many exhibits, I’ll offer a
sample from the “Garden of Longevity”.  It features ten thousand character forms which can be read as some variation on “Long Life”,
in a nice cloister around a serene courtyard.</p>

<p>Now, here’s a sidelight. We had a pretty good card-playing session going after dinner, and one of our party slunk off and came
back with some liquid refreshments; sharing out a couple of these greatly increased the liquidity and joviality of the card game. I
have no idea what it is.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>The Tombs</h2>
<p>I’m talking about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Qing_tombs">Eastern Qing Tombs</a>; as Wikipedia says “the largest, most complete, and
best preserved extant mausoleum complex in China”. They’re big all right, I suppose you could walk around them in a day but you’d be
exhausted. We put in several hours and only saw a few highlights.  Here’s the processional way leading in, flanked by lines of stone
animals. The animals come in pairs, for each species on is standing and another resting, to show that they guarded the tombs 24/7/365.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300548.png" alt="Animal guard at the Eastern Qing Tombs" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300553.png" alt="Animal guard at the Eastern Qing Tombs" />
<p>The variety and beauty of carved stonework is remarkable, and it’s not just sitting there, it’s actively maintained.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300559.png" alt="Maintaining the carvings at the Eastern Qing Tombs" />
<p>We spent a lot of time at the tomb of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qinlong Emperor</a> (1711-99), one of the most successful Chinese rulers
ever, said also to have been a reasonable human being. You can go underground to the actual burial chambers, whose walls are covered with
really remarkable carving.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300574.png" alt="On the walls of the tomb of the Qinlong Emperor" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300575.png" alt="On the walls of the tomb of the Qinlong Emperor" />
<p>The inscription is in Tibetan.  I asked why and our local guide (a required hire, and only adequate) said “Because he was
Buddhist and there are Buddhists in Tibet.” Um, OK.</p>
<p>There were a few merchants scattered among the tombs. This guy’s dried fruit looked excellent and I bought some, which he weighed
out with charming analog technology.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_105658.png" alt="Dried-fruit vendor at the Eastern Qing tombs" />
<p>The dried fruit was shockingly good. I bought a lot and we brought some home (a little worried that might have been illegal); its
flavor hotly intense in the mouth.</p>
<p>This merchant had a huge golden throne, you could dress up as Emperor and Empress and get your picture taken. This guy was
getting ready for his photo and was unhappy at me snapping his picture.  If the <em>real</em> emperor got an expression like that on
his face, it’d probably be curtains for you.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_113339.png" alt="Dressing up for a photo at the Eastern Qing Tombs" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Dowager Empress</h2>
<p>The Qing dynasty was also called Manchu, for Manchurian, and their existence represents a failure of the Great Wall. Eventually
the people on the other side of it came south and became China’s rulers.  Theirs was the last dynasty, extending into the 20th
Century and eventually ended by the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>During its fading years, the most important character was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Dowager Empress Cixi</a>; that link is to her Wikipedia entry, which
has a pretty good photo portrait.  I think she was what today we would call pretty badass, and via a series of regencies was the
effective ruler of China from 1861 until her death in 1908.  She was from a family of the minor aristocracy , was brought into the
ruling family as a concubine, and found her way to the top.</p>
<p>Her tomb is generally great. Here are a couple of pictures of a little shrine that has a wonderful statue of a turtle/dragon
carrying a plinth with an inscription in Chinese, Manchurian, and Mongolian.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_113138.png" alt="Statue at the tomb of Cixi" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/IMG_20190401_113214.png" alt="Statue at the tomb of Cixi" />
<p>And here’s her burial site, with some of the wood of her coffin showing.  It wasn’t a happy period for China, with the imperial
regime declining, partly under pressure from the British and other colonial land-grabbers.  I’d heard of the Dowager Empress, but
what I hadn’t realized that she was a fabulously accomplished artist; here are
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings_by_Empress_Dowager_Cixi">painting</a>
and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1758&amp;bih=1049&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=TgTOXLzkDY7a_wT8j7zIDg&amp;q=calligraphy+by++empress+cixi&amp;oq=calligraphy+by++empress+cixi&amp;gs_l=img.3...48105.49144..49392...0.0..0.65.611.11......1....1..gws-wiz-img.W7XT-msbbvM">calligraphy</a>.
I think I liked them better than any Chinese art that I’ve seen.  Having said that, I’ve mostly seen such art reproduced in books or
on my screen; being face-to-face with these <em>big</em> graphics is really hard-hitting.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300588.png" alt="The coffin of the Dowager Empress Cixi" />
<p>It’s a great tourist site and I recommend it.  Everywhere you look is a treat for the eyes.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/27/XT300593.png" alt="At the Eastern Qing Tombs in Huangyaguan" />
<p>Then we drove a couple of hours back to the haze and hustle of Beijing.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Home networking, I mean, and by phone. Hasn’t been on my mind much, because it’s generally been good enough. But for a
variety of reasons I got an
<a href="https://eero.com/">Eero</a> WiFi setup and so now I have to think about it. </p>
<p>What happened was, our ISP sent us a note saying “We upped your data from 150Mbps to 300.”  Our home infrastructure features Cat5
installed in the last century and an old Apple Time Capsule, none of us remember when we got it.  Also, we’d like
<a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/Jaguar%20Diary/">the new Jaguar</a> to get enough WiFi out in the carport to do downloads.</p>
<p>Wirecutter and a couple of other sites liked the Eero (I was a little surprised that the Google offering isn’t terribly
competitive). Because of the car, I bought a three-box configuration although our house could probably get by with two.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>On Eero generally</h2>
<p>Haven’t had it long enough to say anything about reliability or trouble-shooting, but… what a fabulous onboarding experience.
The time it took to get all three boxes live on the air was dominated by the physical unboxing.  My employer is acquiring
Eero and I think we should immediately double the comp of their UX people then install them in glamorous corner
offices. AWS is getting better at UX, but this is next-level stuff.</p>
<p>Here’s the front page of their Android app.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/01/Screenshot_20190501-220840.png" alt="Eero app" />
<p>The only real flaw is their assumption that my cellphone ISP (the Rogers up at the top)
is the same company as our home ISP, which it isn’t. Amusingly, of the three devices listed, “HTC Corporation” is my Pixel 2,
“Aristophanes” is the 2014 MacBook Pro I’m writing this on, and “android-…” is my son’s beat-up old Motorola.  The network’s name
is “Humpback” because the one it’s replacing was “Orca”.</p>
<p>Down at the bottom, the performance numbers are where it gets interesting.  Our ISP says we’re getting 300M, but this is peak
evening time, someone’s streaming something on the TV and my son’s playing Apex Legends, and I bet similar things are happening at
houses all over our local cable loop.  It turns out the Eero runs network speed tests regularly, and keeps a log.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/05/01/Screenshot_20190501-220800.png" alt="Eero network speed tests" />
<p>You can see that at 5:30PM when everyone’s cooking dinner and commuting, we were actually getting the 300M the ISP
claims. <i>[Late update: It’s 11pm now and Eero says we’re getting 330 down.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How fast?</h2>
<p>Now, it’s not as if that 300M reaches the living room. If I go downstairs and stand near the base modem, I’ve seen as high as
280M on Speedtest.net, but I’ve never seen anything over 150 up where we live.  I haven’t cared enough yet to experiment with
placement.  And the old Mac Pro, wired through the old Time Capsule and another switch in the basement to the cable modem,
never gets near 100.  I suppose I should be unsatisfied with 150 down, 15-or-so up?</p>
<p>And of course these days, when I’m out and about and my phone says “LTE+” up in the status bar, which it does in most civilized
places, Speedtest claims to be
getting 90+ down and 30 or so up.  Which makes me wonder why WiFi is better.
Having said that, in Canada we have a rent-seeking telecoms cartel that rakes in
<a href="http://research.rewheel.fi/downloads/The_state_of_4G_pricing_DFMonitor_11th_release_1H2019_PUBLIC.pdf">among the highest
per-gig mobile data prices in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Good news: The car gets solid WiFi out back.</p>
<p>What does this all mean?  As an old guy, these bandwidths feel absurdly high.  The blockages and slowdowns we occasionally
encounter aren’t here, they’re Out There on the Net somewhere.</p>
<p>I do have a question, though:  What in freaking hell is 5G going to offer that’ll motivate us all to lash out for new
mobiles and services that’ll pay back the titanic investment it’ll take to offer it?  Beats the hellouta
me.</p>

<p>That was the
<a href="https://www.gadventures.com/trips/walk-the-great-wall-of-china/ACGA/">name of the tour</a> and that’s what we did, on each
of five successive days. It was exhausting and thrilling and educational and yielded more good pictures than good stories.  So herewith
an illustrated narrative of what you might expect to do and see if you take this sort of tour.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Tour stuff</h2>
<p>Our party comprised 14 and our tour-guide Lijuan, of whom more
later.  We piled into a
little minibus with our backpacks in the first couple of rows and headed north out of Beijing.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190401_132121.png" alt="Inside the tour bus" />
<p>The party included four Canadian tech geeks and their two 12-year-old daughters and a wine merchant from Sydney; The rest were
from the south of England. They included a contractor/handyman, a rental-real-estate manager, four golfing friends, and young person
between jobs.  We were lucky; they were all good company.</p>
<p>The first thing you learn about the Wall is that it doesn’t run across the Chinese flatlands, but from mountaintop to
mountaintop.  So before you can start walking, you have to climb a
mountain.  Then you proceed up a steep slope to the mountain’s top,
then down the other side and up to the top of the next. Which is
to say, it’s tough walking.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300519.png" alt="Uphill on the Great Wall" />
<h2 id='p-1'>慕田峪</h2>
<p>In our letters,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutianyu">Mutianyu</a>.  It’s not the main close-to-Beijing tourist destination that World
Leaders visit, but neither too distant nor too difficult.  It’s pretty civilized; you can take a lift to the top of the wall and a
weird sort of tube-slider down. You can buy a nice cold beer up on top and enjoy the view. We did all those things.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300282.png" alt="View from the Mutianyu Great Wall" />
<p>Yeah, those views, they’re definitely the thing you’ll remember if you visit the Wall, which while impressive is basically just a
wall. But the mountains and skies are different every minute.  On about the twentieth occasion that after climbing up some brutally steep
staircase I said “Oh… wow” a tourmate said “The views don’t get tired, do they?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>箭扣</h2>
<p>In our letters,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiankou">Jiankou</a>.  After we got off the wall we drove there, not that far, to a
guesthouse in the village of 西栅子 (Xizhazi), which is too small for a Wikipedia entry.  Here’s the lane up to the guesthouse.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300301.png" alt="In Xizhazi village" />
<p>It’s really small, and the guesthouse was, uh, rustically sincere. It’s a regular stop for climbing clubs, whose banners
festooned the central courtyard.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190327_175221.png" alt="Guesthouse in Xizhazi" />
<p>Just down the lane from the guesthouse was this thing, which I had to walk right up to to figure out.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190327_173833.png" alt="Chicken coop in Xizhazi" />
<div class='caption'><p>Chicken coop in Xizhazi.</p></div>
<p>That place may have been primitive, but they served us what I remember as the best food we got on the whole vacation, including
Hong Kong and Beijing.  We had lots of
beers and then it turned out Mr Fong, our driver, had a karaoke machine.  Festivities broke out.  Lauren sang <cite>Both Sides
Now</cite>. A few of the tourist ladies sang <cite>Dancing Queen</cite> and <cite>Valerie</cite>. The two twelve-year-olds sang
<cite>Shut Up and Dance</cite>.  Mr Fong sang a romantic Chinese song by himself<span class='dashes'> —</span> a real crooner’s
voice<span class='dashes'> —</span> and then a duet with Lijuan the guide.</p>

<p>I want to stop and pay tribute to her. Lijuan Duan, is a special person, with endless expertise and energy. She
also owns the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g528741-d1898073-Reviews-Mekong_Cafe-Jinghong_Yunnan.html">Meking
Cafe</a>, a well-reviewed restaurant in Southern China, and is generally an excellent person.</p>
<p>Speaking of excellent people, so is Mr Fong.  Among other things, a
fantastically deft driver and a fine singer.
Well, as far as we could make out,
because he doesn’t speak much English.</p>
<p>It was a freezing cold night and the guesthouse was mostly unheated.  We were bundled up, enjoying the company, eating and
drinking, and the guesthouse owner joined us.  Then I saw a lovely tired lined face looking at us from out in the unsheltered
courtyard, looking amazed at the blonde people and the singing, not daring to come in. I’m betting she’s the one who made that
excellent food.  In the villages of China you see the occasional child but no young people.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we got up the next morning to start climbing, and found that it was snowing pretty hard.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190328_082229.png" alt="Snow in Xizhazi" />
<p>Fortunately, the guesthouse was not completely without heat.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190328_082533.png" alt="Stove in Xizhazi" />
<p>It was an hour’s pretty ambitious hike up to the Wall in the snow.</p>

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300316.png" alt="Climbing up to the Jiankou great wall" />
<p>See Mr Fong there with his umbrella?  What you can’t see is that he’s wearing shiny street shoes. In spite of which he was by a
mile our best climber on the scary parts of the climb.  And boy, were there ever a lot of them.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300334.png" alt="The Jiankou Great Wall in snow" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300339.png" alt="The Jiankou Great Wall in snow" />
<p>I think that was our best day on the Wall.  I’ll never see anything like that again.</p>
<p>When we came down, we were exhausted.  What with all the snow and having taken a
few minor tumbles and general exhaustion, my hands were sufficiently beat-up that for two solid days I couldn’t fingerprint-unlock my
phone.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>古北口</h2>
<p>In our letters,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gubeikou">Gubeikou</a>.  We drove there after we came down off the snowy Wall, and the
guesthouse was a little more modern but not as welcoming nor was the food as good.  But it’s got a nice little riverfront park and some
excellent temples.</p>

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300372.png" alt="Drying cabbage in Gubeikou" />
<h2 id='p-3'>The Long March</h2>
<p>The Gubeikou wall is OK, nothing special, neither the views nor the Wall itself equaled what we’d already seen. But that day was
brutal. We walked for six hours cross-country along the wall, or beside it in ruined sectors, to our next stop, and it was really
cold and windy nearly every step.
It was about 12km, which I’d have no trouble walking horizontally at a decent temperature, neither of which
applied here.  Here’s our tour-group, and a section of the Wall that we walked every inch of.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_102848.png" alt="Tour group on Gubeikou Great Wall" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_103605.png" alt="Gubeikou Great Wall" />
<p>Finally, we limped down the mountain, and I have rarely been as happy to see a human face as Mr Fong’s, waving “come
<em>this</em> way!” at the bottom of the path.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>金山岭</h2>
<p>In our letters, Jinshanling.  Probably the nicest and best-maintained part of the Wall.  When we stumbled into our guesthouse
there, it was under construction outside, but squeaky-clean inside, and in our room the heater had been turned on and set to
30°C, unreasonably warm unless you’ve just spent six hours trudging over Chinese mountaintops in
a freezing wind.  After 45 minutes or so, I was somewhat thawed.</p>
<p>Here’s the dining room, where we got in a few games of Mah Jongg.  You don’t see a ceiling like that every day.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190329_174820.png" alt="Guesthouse in Jinshanling" />

<p>If you wanted to make a one-day Wall visit and maybe didn’t want to take on the near-verticals of Jiankou, I’d say Jinshanling is
the place to go.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/IMG_20190330_103717.png" alt="Jinshanling Great Wall" />

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/22/XT300452.png" alt="Jinshanling Great Wall" />
<p>There was one more day on the wall, at 黄崖关 (Huangyaguan) in Tianjin province, but meh, nothing to write home about after what
we’d already seen.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Take-aways</h2>
<p>It’s fantastic. Belongs on most bucket lists.  Take a guide.</p>
<p>Lijuan says the best time to go is in Autumn, and I think that’s probably right. I’ll never forget those views.</p>

<p>It’s complicated.  No big city offers just one flavor. Beijing (only China’s third biggest) has plenty.
I feel no need to go back (see
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/Disliking-Beijing">Disliking Beijing</a>) but I liked some.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Dancing!</h2>
<p>Our headquarters was the
<a href="http://www.laurelhotelbeijing.com/">Laurel Hotel</a>; the district seemed to be called Jiaomen, and it was… nothing
special. But it had street life, notably including dancing. There were three separate dance scenes within a couple of blocks.  We’re
talking about a ghetto-blaster on a stand on the plaza in front of a mall or apartment building, maybe a dance leader, and then a
gaggle of couples with wildly varying skill, dancing apparently for pure pleasure.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/VID_20190401_211640-2.png" alt="Dance out-take" />
<div class='caption'><p>An out-take from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNguRAD6w-Q">seventeen seconds of video</a> on YouTube.</p></div>
<p>Another scene elsewhere on the same plaza was a little more downtempo, and then another on a darker plaza very
old-school<span class='dashes'> —</span> strictly waltzes<span class='dashes'> —</span> and more romantic.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Dogs</h2>
<p>Beijing’s pups are excellent. They’re mostly medium-sized, neither hulking nor tiny, a lot of them somehow look sort of
Chinese, and by and large are cheery, quiet, and well-behaved.  A lot of them are off-leash, trotting along keeping pace with
their people, staying out of trouble.  Mostly they look neither overstressed nor underfed, including the ones trotting here and
there <i>sans</i> human, looking like they know where they’re going.  I gather they are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat">at some risk</a> of being eaten; but a tip of the hat to the non-dog-eating people
who seem to be taking good care of theirs.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Silent driving!</h2>
<p>In the accompanying Dislike piece I bitched about Beijing’s overly-wide over-occupied streets. It turns out that the big ones come with
little mini-streets on each side for use by anything that’s not a car, which includes bikes, motorcycles, and a whole lot of
power-trikes, where the space behind the driver can be a seat for a couple of passengers, or a rack for power tools, or really
anything in between.  What you can’t help noticing is that (in <em>my</em> Beijing hood, anyhow) more than half of these non-cars
are now electric.  Doesn’t mean that you won’t get creamed and rushed to emergency if you don’t focus (unless of course
you powerfully radiate no-fucks-to-give-here), but these auxiliary streets are kind of peaceful, I wish Vancouver had more like this.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of snaps, illustrating the minor-street-off-major-street thing.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300702.png" alt="Streetside Beijing traffic" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300705.png" alt="Streetside Beijing traffic" />
<p>Check out the brown polka-dotted thing on the front of the red-coated dude’s bike. I’d never seen one before but they’re
everywhere in Beijing. It gets cold there in winter and I guess one of these will keep you warm without having to suit up in a dorky
cycling outfit.</p>
<p>Speaking of electric vehicles, China knows it’s got a pollution problem and is working on it.  We were driving along a nice
modern highway and stopped in at a service center, totally like the kind we have here at home along the highway, and it had a brand-new
electric-vehicle charging station.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/charging-station.png" alt="EV charging station in China" />
<p>That car is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto">BYD</a>, a domestic Chinese automaker that pumps out lots of electrics. If the
picture looks
a little weird that’s because I fat-fingered the Pixel into “portrait” mode. The driver got a little tense and
nervous when the large foreigner strolled over and started taking his picture.  Sorry about that, dude; if I spoke a word of Chinese
I’d have chatted you up, as a fellow EV owner, wanting to know about the finer points of charging China.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Temple of Heaven</h2>
<p>Our last day in Beijing was the best, someone recommended the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Heaven">Temple of Heaven</a>, and is it ever great.  Not the temples, the place and
the people. It’s green and away from traffic and has plenty of room for everyone<span class='dashes'> —</span> none of which is
otherwise in plentiful in Beijing.  Not that it was empty, it was buzzing, mostly with old people, most of them wholesomely
active.</p>
<p>Here are a bunch of dudes playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi">毽子 (Jianzi)</a>, hackey-sack with a big shuttlecock, which dates back 2400 years or
so in China.  These guys were not young but damn, they were deft, deploying lots of slick behind-the back and knee-to-foot and
heel-kick moves, and that shuttlecock wasn’t hitting the ground very often at all.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300606.png" alt="Jianzi players in the Temple of Heaven" />
<p>Then there was this big area full of exercise equipment, mostly occupied, mostly by older folk, here and there a child in
evidence.  I tried a thing I can only describe as a knee-swinging striding machine, and it made my legs feel great! Wish there was
one in our neighborhood park.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300611.png" alt="Exercising in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing" />
<p>Another thing that happens in the park is music; people go out and practice. Here’s one area that attracts saxophonists; this picture
only catches a couple, but there were more.  They’re within earshot of each other but that doesn’t seem to bother them.  I strolled
down the middle and among all the practice phrasing it was like a performance of abstract modern music; not unpleasant at
all.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300609.png" alt="Saxophonists practice in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing" />
<p>Then there was this guy with a lap guitar and beatbox, he had loads of soul. Seriously,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eccvUADunNo">check the video</a>.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/VID_20190402_093754-1.png" alt="Swinging guitar in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing" />
<p>At another point there was a dude singing opera with accordion accompaniment, and while he neither looked nor sounded
exceptional, he was competent and it was a fine thing to be sitting in the green listening to the arias.  Did I mention it was green
and spacious?</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300620.png" alt="Green space in the Temple of Heaven park, Beijing" />
<p>Occasionally there would be a person alone among the trees practicing Tai Chi.</p>
<p>And oh, right, temples too.  These are from the
Temple of Fasting (also “of Abstention”).</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300625.png" alt="Temple of Fasting, Beijing" />

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300629.png" alt="Temple of Fasting, Beijing" />
<p>At this point I should say that, while in the “Disliking” piece I kind of dissed the Forbidden City, it had, if you went off to
the side, some purely exquisite spaces. Here are two.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300205.png" alt="In the Forbidden City, Beijing" />
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190326_124032.png" alt="In the Forbidden City, Beijing" />
<p>Back to the people; here’s a random nice outfit.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190402_091125.png" alt="Lady in pink shiny top" />
<p>After the temple, we went to
<a href="http://jingabrewing.com/">京A Brewing</a> and after two weeks of Chinese food I heartily enjoyed a cheeseburger and a very
decent IPA.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/IMG_20190402_135635.png" alt="Jing-A Brewing, Beijing" />
<p>Then we strolled through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangfujing">Wangfujing</a>, a high-toned expensive shopping district, with a side-bazaar
in which you can buy any imaginable food that can be presented on a stick as well as some that never should be such as scorpions,
still wiggling.  Wangfujing is fun if a little ostentatious, I recommend it.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300691.png" alt="Ice cream in Wangfujing, Beijing" />
<p>On our last morning, before heading to the airport we walked randomly around the residential parts of Jiaomen; it was a quiet
sunny morning, the pollution not too bad.  There were oldsters on exercise machines in parks and playing/kibitzing chess games and
just hanging out.  A guy working on an electrical box beamed when we gave him a <i>Nihao</i>.  The buildings are low-rises, older. I
think if you had to live in Beijing, this might not be the worst place.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/15/XT300732.png" alt="Building in Jiaomen, Beijing" />
<p>The best thing about Beijing is the people there. I hope they get a better government before too long.</p>

<p>Not only do Beijing’s ring roads (seven of them!) have a

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Ring_Road">2nd</a>,

The streets are big and wide and full of aggression; traffic is a competitive sport which you win by convincing others that you
have fewer fucks to give. Lane invasion is basic, and a key technique is that neither a lane’s invader nor its defender must ever
look at nor otherwise acknowledge each other until someone inevitably brakes and gives way.</p>
<p>All the roads are full, all the time.  “The airport’s half an hour away, better allow ninety minutes to be sure” they said, and
it took us sixty; things got faster after we got past these guys.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/14/IMG_20190403_115526.png" alt="Beijing highway problem" />
<p>The roads are full and the sidewalks and subways are too, full of people.  One place they’re especially full is around
Tienanmen square.  You arrive at the subway and have to parade through endless packed passages and staircases, emerge across
the street, then through another tunnel to come up into its vastness.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Heading for Tienanmen.</p></div>
<p>And I just can’t talk about that place without getting into politics.  Let’s be clear: In 2019, the
<a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn">Communist Party of China</a> is the world’s leading oppressor of human beings.
I’m not going to enumerate all the sins here, but it’s worth mentioning the pervasive censorship, the savage oppression of ethnic
minorities, and the corruption that flows Lamborghinis steadily onto the streets of Vancouver.  It’s not just the air that stinks.</p>
<p>The Great Wall
was built at extreme cost in blood and treasure to protect the Chinese people from the barbarians outside. To me it looks like the
barbarians won, and are now headquartered in the Great Hall of the People.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Great Hall of the People.</p></div>
<p>Which is of course overlooks Tienanmen. To be honest the whole place made me shudder. The security apparatus is
ubiquitous, in-yo-face every moment.  Quite likely, one of these years the people of China will run out of patience and terminate
the barbarian claque. But you can be damn sure that the trouble isn’t gonna start in Tienanmen, that puppy is locked down so tight it
squeaks.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Tienanmen there is shouting<span class='dashes'> —</span> the tour-group wranglers I mean, chivvying
their parties, usually dressed in matching T-shirts or caps, this way or that.  Look around; the square may be at the city’s center,
but you can’t really get onto it from any of the surrounding roads.  Nor out, either; the barbarians learned an important tactical
lesson.</p>

<p>Yeah, China may have lifted a billion people out of poverty, but they didn’t have to do this to do that.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>No Truth here</h2>
<p>In China, your phone can’t get to the BBC or CNN or Google or Twitter or Facebook.  Unless you’re running with a foreign SIM.
But if you have one then you can’t connect to the hotel or any other public WiFi.</p>
<p>I look at China’s generations and
they look more different from each other than ours do.  The oldest ones saw endless war, the middle-aged ones went through the
Cultural Revolution, and there are all these sharp-dressed young folk who’ve only ever known a modern-ish
fast-growing China where all your daily needs are probably pretty well satisfied, as long they don’t include knowing what’s
happening outside China, or the truth about what’s happening inside. Old people aren’t just short, they’re beat-down; but
many young Chinese men are taller than me.</p>
<p>Behind Tienanmen is The Forbidden City.  They had some lovely things and quiet courtyards in the Treasure House, but frankly, it
mostly wasn’t that beautiful and there was nothing to warm your heart.  It is huge beyond hugeness, and entirely designed to assert
the power of the State over its cowed citizens.  The State in those days was personalized, with a living breathing Emperor.  Some of those
were barbarians too, by birth or by habit.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Some of the eighty thousand or so a day tourists<br/>who stream through the Forbidden City.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>Also breakfast</h2>
<p>Along with the car-centrism and the barbaric dictatorship, there are the breakfasts.  I loathe, loathe, loathe Chinese city
breakfast and it cast a pall over every day I had to start with one.
But this prejudice is a failing in me, not in the city.</p>
<p>I was awfully happy to get in the bus and head out to the Great Wall.</p>

<p>I bought the latest Fuji in Hong Kong.  Herewith the how and why, and twenty-four Chinese-flavored photos
as supporting evidence. Um, if you’re visiting on a less-than-fast Internet link, you might have to wait a bit for ’em.
Sorry ’bout that.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>

These guys yelled at me to stop shooting, but with a camera small and fast enough you can get a couple before they notice.</p></div>
<p>I’ve been shooting with the Fujifilm X-T1
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2014/04/27/Fuji-X-T1">for five years</a> and it’s made me very happy. Not too long ago, I bought an
X-T2, and then a few days later dropped it four feet onto pavement. Sob. Then Fuji shipped the X-T3 and
I’d decided to pick one up for the Chinese excursion, but before I did they followed up with this thing.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Lunch break in Beijing’s Forbidden City.<br/>35mm, 1/1000, <i>f</i>/5.6, ISO 160.</p></div>
<p>Let’s see… same sensor and processor, smaller and lighter (383g as opposed to 539), not waterproof (but most of my lenses aren’t
either). Slightly less video mojo (I use my phone for that).  $600 cheaper.  Of these criteria, the size and weight were the biggies
for me; it was compactness that moved me from SLR to the mirrorless space six years ago, and remember, I was just heading out on a
walking-oriented trip that was listed as “challenging”.  This was not a difficult choice.</p>

<p>Problem was, the camera hit the shelves on March 20th, the same day I was getting on a trans-Pacific flight at noon.
No problemo!  Because
<a href="https://www.wingshingphoto.com/">萬成/永成攝影器材</a> (Wing Shing photo) was right around the corner from my Hong Kong
hotel, so when I arrived (on the 21st) I went there for a walk after supper.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>By the Forbidden City’s exit. 35mm, 1/500, <i>f</i>/4.5, ISO 160.</p></div>
<p>The X-T30 was in stock, in all the color trims.  I asked “how much?” and they told me, I said “let me check the price back
home” and used my phone to pull up the Canadian price.  The store was a little quiet and the other Wing Shing dudes gathered around,
amused.  Turns out Fuji has steely price discipline; the prices were within $10. The dudes were impressed.
They threw in a 64G card and HK doesn’t have
sales tax.  And when I got back home the Canadian customs lady decided not to charge me the sales tax, which she could have.</p>

<h2 id='p-2'>Findings</h2>
<p>None of these should surprise anybody who keeps an eye on Fuji.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> Oh, it’s so light!  And as will become apparent when I tell climbing-the-Great-Wall stories, that really matters.</p>

<p><i>Item:</i> It’s noticeably faster than my X-T1, both turn-on lag and shooting time.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> Moving from 16 to 26 million pixels slows down Lightroom import, but lets me crop more aggressively to fix composition
mistakes.</p>

160.<br/>I wish you could see this on the big retina screen.</p></div>
<p><i>Item:</i> The dumb “Q” button, which I don’t use anyhow, is idiotically placed so it really takes practice to avoid hitting it all the
time.</p>

Samyang/X-T30 combo yet; that’s OK.</p></div>
<p><i>Item:</i> Some combination of the touch-screen and overly thorough state retention meant that a high proportion of the times I picked
up the camera, the focus area was off uselessly in some corner or another.  I changed multiple settings: Disabled
the touch screen, required punch-to-activate on the joystick, maybe more; and eventually this stopped happening.  Now I can go back
and judiciously relax the settings.</p>
<p><i>ProTip:</i> When this does happen, press the joystick down (twice maybe) and that recenters
the focus.  This is terribly important to me because I’m a reaction shooter and when I bring the camera up to my eye and aim at what
I’m reacting to, I don’t want to waste time moving the focus around.</p>

<p><i>Item:</i> I haven’t figured out how to get much benefit from the touch-screen.  When I turn it back on I’ll have to put some study into
that.</p>

160<br/>Needs to be blown up room-size.</p></div>
<p><i>Item:</i> The controls take the usual Fuji loads-of-dials approach, but the ISO dial has been subtracted, replaced by a mode selector
(single-shot, video, panorama, bracketing, motor drive, yadda yadda) that used to be squashed underneath it. For me this is a
win/win, since I hand-selected an ISO exactly once in the six years I’ve been in Fuji-land, but I regularly want to switch modes.
Way back in 2013, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/10/18/Fufifilm-X-E1#p-2">pronounced the Fuji controls “perfect”</a> and I pretty well stand by that
finding. Everything I ever want to change is available on a handy physical dial, and nothing else is there getting in the way.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Blossoms near Jinshanling.  35mm, 1/680, <i>f</i>/4.5, ISO 160.</p></div>
<p><i>Item:</i> The EVF is not as big as I’m used to and I miss that, but I can’t honestly claim that it’s cost me pictures.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>In the Huangyaguan Great Wall Museum.<br/>35mm, 1/1250, <i>f</i>/6.4, ISO
160.</p></div>
<p><i>Item:</i> The new joystick on the back is really well-executed; just the right size, just the right sensitivity, does just the right thing.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300597.png" alt="At the tomb of the Dowager Empress Cixi" />

<i>f</i>/5.6, ISO 160.<br/>Enlarge and see what’s looking out that door.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-3'>Who’s it for?</h2>
<p>It’s like this: Some people plan their photos, others find them.  I’m a finder, 100%.  Which means I need the
camera to be always with me, and shoot fast, and have <em>really</em> good ergonomics.  If you’re like me, the X-T30 might just be
the best camera in the world.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300649.png" alt="Lauren at 京A Brewing" />

320.<br/>Mother by daughter.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>One is not enough</h2>
<p>I carry two cameras, of course: this and the Pixel-2.  Of the China-trip photos I decided to keep, 167 were Pixel and 283 were
Fujifilm.  That’s a little misleading because there are a few X-T30 motor-drive action sequences of kids cartwheeling and swinging on
ropes and so on.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300683.png" alt="Ducklings on a Stick near Wangfujing" />
<div class='caption'><p>Ducklings on a stick near Wangfujing. 35mm, 1/120, <i>f</i>/1.8, ISO
160.<br/>Wish I’d gone for a bit more depth-of-field.</p></div>
<p>Phones aren’t going to replace “real” cameras until someone figures out how to install long lenses on them.  Also, a phone is a
general-purpose device while every atom of the X-T30 is optimized for making shooting easy and productive.  But the Pixel is so
fabulously effective at wide-angles and close-up shots and people, I don’t think of it as being a “better” or “worse” camera than
the Fuji, just different.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300708.png" alt="Beijing small vehicles" />
<div class='caption'><p>Beijing micromobility. 35mm, 1/50, <i>f</i>/8, ISO 160.<br/>There’s a big cool photo-project in this.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-5'>Lensing</h2>
<p>I took four: 18-55mm F2.8-4 (135 photos), 35mm F1.4 (86), 55-200mm F3.5-4.8 (49), Samyang 135mm F2 (12).  The 18-55mm has
lightning autofocus and on the X-T30 is just insanely fast and flexible, ideal when you have no idea what kind of thing you’re going to
shoot but you’re going to need to shoot quick.  The 35mm is my all-time favorite lens, its autofocus is klunky but it makes
everything you point it at look better. The 55-200mm doesn’t have much personality but if you’re going to be climbing mountains and
so on, you sometimes really need all those millimeters. The Samyang is maddeningly difficult and super-opinionated, not to mention
cruelly bulky and heavy,  but when you find the right subject, it’s a miracle-worker.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/11/XT300723.png" alt="Blossom in Jiaomen, Beijing" />
<div class='caption'><p>Blossom in Jiaomen, Beijing. Seven hundred twenty-third.<br/>35mm, 1/1600, <i>f</i>/4, ISO 160.</p></div>
<p>I consciously adopted a discipline of going out with one flexible zoom and one difficult/opinionated prime: Usually the 35mm and
18/55 in town, then in the country, either 18-55 and Samyang, or the 35 and 55-200. I refuse to carry a big camera bag so two lenses
is about all I can manage out on the trail.   I liked this formula and think I’ll stick with it for a while.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Assuming I avoid dropping this thing, it should last me a long time.  I still have the X-T1; I give it to my
twelve-year-old daughter with the 18-55mm screwed on and everything set to auto, and she goes nuts, taking hundreds of photos of
which a few turn out great.</p>
<p>I don’t think you can get more camera for the money. I don’t think I can get a better camera for my style for any money.</p>

<p>That’s the distance from Hong Kong to Beijing, and if you’re on a train that cruises at 306km/h, you can leave at 8:05AM and

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_West_Kowloon_railway_station">Hong Kong West Kowloon station</a> is bright and
new and huge.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>

<p>It’s faster than an airport but there are really a lot of stages to get through: HK exit, HK customs, security, PRC health, PRC
customs, PRC immigration.  They were all reasonably efficient and pleasant but damn it’s a lot of walking. Obvious foreigners are
waved over to the “special services” PRC immigration where they speak English.  As in most dictatorships, there’s plenty of assiduous
filling-in of forms and triple-checking numbers and photos and signatures.</p>
<p>The train interior is, well, meh.  Nothing terribly wrong with it but not as slick as either the Japanese <i>shinkansen</i> or
a Euro-TGV/ICE.  There are classes: Business, First, Second. We took the mid-range First; the price was reasonable and the seats
were OK, with a bit of lean-back and plenty of electricity.</p>

<p>The food was awful, but it’s been a long time since I got good food on a train anywhere.  I had to respect the staff, who
pushed the tea-carts and refreshments back and forth for nine consecutive hours without exhibiting fatigue.  None
seemed to have a word of English.</p>
<p>If you want to travel, direct online ticket sales are difficult-at-best for foreigners.  We followed leads around the Internet
and eventually bought the tickets via
<a href="https://www.chinahighlights.com/">China Highlights</a>, who got them from the station and delivered them to our Hong Kong
hotel before we got there.</p>
<p>Traveling at 300km is sort of dreamy.  I don’t have a good way to host video myself, so here are
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzmWqyCDgyA">27 seconds on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>During the first couple of hours, the sky was that South Chinese dappled-grey while the terrain was green, folded, and wet.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/XT300149.png" alt="South China from the train" />
<p>Two thousand kilometers, but rarely out of sight of human habitation, and never away from infrastructure: Power
lines, dikes, culverts, you name it.</p>
<p>As we worked our way north the land became flatter and dirtier and more industrial and more intensely under construction.  This
picture is unusual in that there are no visible cranes.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/IMG_20190325_131934.png" alt="Industrial scene in central China" />
<p>Any extended exposure to China<span class='dashes'> —</span> this theme will recur<span class='dashes'> —</span> leaves most
Westerners overwhelmed by its most significant fact: its huge population.  On this trip the train stopped at
Shenzhen (pop 12.9M), Guanghzhou (14.9M), Changsha (a mere 7.4M), Wuhan (10.6M), Zhengzhou (10.1M), and Shijiazhuang
(10.8M). Total: 66.7M human souls.  You can claim you already knew about those places but I probably wouldn’t believe you.</p>
<p>It’s not subtle: as you coast from city to city, often the horizon hides behind a forest of high-rises.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/IMG_20190325_144229.png" alt="Somewhere in central China" />
<p>In the picture above, it all looks kind of prosperous: The pretty-modern buildings in the background, the gas stations and
boulevards in front.  It’s not all like that; in the hilly green southern section you see really poor-ass rural
scenes, but the surface prosperity monotonically increases as you move further north and toward Beijing.</p>
<p>Wherever you go in the world, you can usually tell a lot about a person by their address, and even more by visiting that address
and looking at their residence.  I’m sure you can in China too, only I can’t because I don’t know anything, and it was frustrating.
There were low primitive places among the fields, little better than shacks, then two-story countryside clusters that
offered a little room but no apparent luxury, then the ubiquitous apartment towers, low and high, shiny and faded.  What does
it all mean? Ask elsewhere.</p>
<p>I noticed that out away from the cities there was a lot of empty space on the roads; thought how much fun it might be to
do a road trip in a fast car.</p>
<p>Obviously, China’s decades-long  avalanche of investment and development hasn’t had flawless execution. There are many towers
built but not finished, their windows unoccupied concrete rectangles, some finished partway up but no apparent work in progress.
Bridges and causeways and berms and embankments too: infrastructural work paused and left to stand like huge pieces of brutalist
sculpture.</p>
<p>But of course lots of construction is in active progress; this near Beijing.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/09/XT300164.png" alt="Residential construction near Beijing" />
<p>Beijing West station, when you get there, is insanely crowded but reasonably efficient; the only thing you have to be careful of
is the taxi touts who I’m told will rip you off.  They’re somewhat handicapped in that a native Chinese speaker who hasn’t studied
English really has trouble with our letter “x”, but they have hustle.
Follow the signs to the nice modern taxi-stand and you won’t have to wait long. It’s a good idea to visit your
hotel’s website before you go and find the place where they provide a map-with-directions you can print out and show the
driver.</p>
<p>Then you’re into Beijing traffic, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>

<p>Its official name is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Tan_Buddha">Tian Tan Buddha</a> but everyone in Hong Kong just says “Big Buddha” and
indeed it’s maybe the biggest tourist attraction. That’s OK, it’s worth visiting and you probably should if you’re there.  I offer no
insights about Asian religions but some possibly-useful tourist advice and a couple of pictures that make me smile.</p>
<p>[This is part of <a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/China-2019/">The Surface of China</a> series.]</p>
<p>You can get a ferry from Pier 6 on Central over to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mui_Wo">Mui Wo</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantau_Island">Lantau Island</a>, where the Buddha is, along with both Buddhist and Christian
monasteries, the new airport, Disneyland, and some damn nice hiking trails; I spent a pleasurable few hours on those a couple of
decades ago. Anyhow, when we were there in March the marine weather was awful, so no pix from the boat. But Mui Wo is…
different. Green, uncrowded (by HK standards) and weirdly full of foreigners.  I can see wanting to live here if I were working
there.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300056.png" alt="Small boats at Mui Wo" />
<p>Then you take a taxi or a bus across the island to Ngong Ping where the Buddha is.  If there are three or four of you the cost is
probably a wash, but the taxis can be hard to get. It’s a charming ride, a half-hour or so; try to get a window seat on the left.
The village isn’t worth your time really, but the religious enclosure, including Buddha and the Po Lin monastery, is. It was a foggy
day.</p>

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300071.png" alt="The stairs up to the Tian Tan Buddha" />
<div class='caption'><p>There are a lot of steps up to the Buddha;<br/>this was on a weekend day, but out of season.</p></div>
<p>There’s a nice little art exhibit and gift shop inside the base of the Buddha. It’s not free, but your ticket also counts at the
souvenir stands and the monastery’s vegetarian restaurant.</p>
<p>From up on top, the view is nice out to sea and down to the monastery.</p>

<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300090.png" alt="The Po Lin Monastery" />
<p>The Buddha is surrounded by really rather nice statues.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/IMG_20190323_130719.png" alt="Statues around the Tian Tan Buddha" />
<p>Religion is actively practiced; this one particular shrine received a regular flow of people who knelt and prayed.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/04/07/XT300097.png" alt="Worshipper at the Po Li monastery" />
<p>The most impressive part of the trip was guarded by “No photography” signs.  In a big room up at the back of the temple, a
religious service was in progress.  The audience was in three groups, each with priests at the front. There was rough but beautiful
priest-led crowd-supported chanting, with the sections alternately standing and kneeling.  I stood and watched for several minutes
and the chanting never stopped.</p>
<p>It bothers me that, while I’ve studied some Buddhist basics, I really haven’t the faintest idea what these people learned as kids
from the parents or as young people from the clergy; nor what the ceremony meant; nor what a modern Hong Kong Buddhist is likely to
actually believe.</p>

<div class='caption'><p>Major incense!</p></div>
<p>In normal times there’s a cable car that’ll take you straight to Ngong Ping from the big MTR (public transit) station by the
airport, but it wasn’t working that day so we hopped a taxi and got into some real adventure because Lantau traffic was light and
the driver ninja’d each and every of the many turns on the way to the train, wheels screeching.  Halfway, he turned to us, eyes crinkling:
“Roller coaster!” he said, beaming.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Just the surface?</h2>
<p>I’ve mostly recovered from the jetlag hangover and see that I have 500-ish photos worth keeping and several screens-full of raw
notes.  So, as photog and blogger, I ought to be eager to share. There’s a problem: It’s all surface stuff.  Did I get lots of
interesting visuals? Did I eat lots of interesting food?  Did I get off the beaten track?  Yes to all of those.</p>
<p>But, how many
Chinese people did I get into serious conversations with? Three. Did those conversations go near any of the difficult subjects of
history or government or truth? Nope.  Do I understand what life feels like for any of the people I saw and
occasionally photographed?  No.</p>
<p>So I’ll share pictures because they’re pretty and stories that I think interesting or entertaining or
maybe useful to other Westerners planning a visit.  But, don’t kid yourself that you’re going to learn anything deep or important
about China beyond what it looks like.  This wasn’t research, it was tourism.</p>

<h2 id='p-2'>Notes on getting around</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Vancouver to HK is 12½ hours; that’s rough.</p></li>
<li><p>Hong Kong is easy to get around in; get an Octopus card at the first opportunity and public transit will take you more or
less anywhere at a reasonable price.  Taxis are OK but (like everywhere in the world) traffic is terrible.</p></li>
<li><p>The long fast train from HK to Beijing was a treat. The train food is trash but the seats are comfy and you’ll see a whole
lot of China really fast.  The train stations at either end are reasonably efficient and manageable.</p></li>
<li><p>The
<a href="https://www.gadventures.com/">G Adventures</a> tour was excellent.  I’m not normally a guided-tour kind of person, and have
enough travel experience and language smatterings to get by most places, not including mainland China.  Our guide and driver
were excellent, the route well-chosen, and the price very reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>Beijing is tough to get around in.  The subway system is easy to figure out but the ticket-selling machines are klunky and
failure-prone, and the place is so freaking huge that you’re often a long walk from the nearest station. Taxi fares are
reasonable, but near any major tourist attraction the drivers will refuse to go on-meter and demand exorbitant prices.</p></li>
<li><p>The traffic in Beijing is terrible too.  Imagine that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Sharing plans</h2>
<p>I have way too many pictures to blog or Tweet or whatever; come over for dinner if you’re in town and I’ll do a slide show.  I’ll
write a few blog fragments and share some of the prettier pix, and after all a close look at the surface of China is better than no
look at all.</p>

<p>I just finished reading
<a href="https://amzn.to/2O8VDRS">The Seventh Function of Language</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Binet">Laurent Binet</a>; it’s impossibly erudite and also hilarious.  <em>If</em> you remember the

it, especially if you’re also entertained by sex, violence, and conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I was in the library looking at travel guides for an upcoming vacation, and as I was coming down the escalator the book’s garish
cover grabbed my attention sufficiently that I had to go look at it, and then took it home.  There’s a story in here about signs and
signals and that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>It’s a whodunnit basically, although the author chats away in his own voice, the protagonist keeps wondering if he’s in a novel,
the story shamelessly mixes real things that happened to real people with things that definitely didn’t happen and others might be
true but nobody will ever know.</p>
<p>Things that did happen in 1980-81.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes">Roland Barthes</a> was hit by a laundry van after having lunch with
Mitterrand; the papers he was carrying were stolen,  and he died a month later of his injuries.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Althusser">Louis Althusser</a> strangled his wife in what the courts consider an
episode of insanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-wing terrorists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_massacre">bombed Bologna’s central train station</a>,
killing 85 people.</p></li>
<li><p>Mitterrand won the first of several elections as President of France.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Things that didn’t:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a> was <em>not</em> killed by attack dogs unleashed on Cornell
University campus by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle">John Searle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Sollers">Philippe Sollers</a> was <em>not</em> castrated as a consequence of
losing a semioticians’ fight-club debate with Umberto Eco.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Things we’ll never know:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How did Mitterrand hang on to office for so long?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to Barthes’ papers?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-1'>Fun as in fun</h2>
<p>Seriously, I kept laughing out loud.  While there’s deep thinking here about language and meaning, there are fabulous chase scenes,
appalling violence, sexual fireworks on a dissecting table, mysterious Japanese ninjas, and a whole lot of sex &amp; drugs &amp;
rock-n-roll. And tennis.</p>
<p>And name-dropping; the whole book is one big name-drop, and a lot of the names are portrayed having inappropriate sex and taking
inappropriate drugs.  But he does it so well that you can’t help but be amused.  Well, except for some of those portrayed are still
very alive and might not be; can you sue someone for the way they portray you in a work of fiction?
For example, I wonder if a certain prominent female American gender theorist will object to having been
portrayed as sodomizing a burly French policeman in a threesome including a prominent female French poststructuralist?</p>
<p>Anyhow, by now you probably know whether you’re a candidate to enjoy this one.</p>

<p>I took my 12-year-old and 19-year-old to see
<a href="http://www.thesaucerfulofsecrets.com/">Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets</a> tour (Lauren had choir practice).
The band was grizzled, grey, and genial; when Nick closed by saying “We hope you had as
much fun as we did” we felt he meant it.  Their stage banter
was that of well-bred Englishmen, dry and mild.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick’s opening remarks: <i>Hi there. This isn’t The Australian Roger Waters or The Danish Dave Gilmours.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>For context:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason">Nick Mason</a> is the only drummer Pink Floyd ever had.  The concept is
that, since the various Floyd incarnations mostly perform numbers starting with <cite>Dark Side of the Moon</cite> but there was a
lot of good pre-<cite>Dark Side</cite> Floyd, that’s what Nick and the boys are playing.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Saucerful_of_Secrets">A Saucerful of Secrets</a>, from 1968, was Floyd’s second album, but
its songs don’t dominate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/nick-mason/2019/queen-elizabeth-theatre-vancouver-bc-canada-1b922528.html">Here are the
songs they played</a> (setlist.fm is remarkable). I knew maybe half, where by “knew” means they’re buried in my hindbrain
from unimaginably
long ago.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Nick: <i>Hi Vancouver, nice to be back.  Last time I was here was… 1970. Anyone here remember 1970?  Neither do
I.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia says: “The band includes long-time Pink Floyd and David Gilmour bass player Guy Pratt; Blockheads guitarist Lee Harris;
Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp on guitar and vocals; and producer/composer Dom Beken on keyboards.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick: <i>Let me introduce the Saucers.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>We were down near the stage, so got too much guitar and not enough drums/voice - on Set the Controls, Nick's epic tom-tom rhythm
was sadly dim.
The sound would have been guitar-heavy wherever you sat, but (once the sound guys had a chance to settle things down in the early minutes)
pretty clean.  Well, except for where the band wanted a chaotic noise crescendo.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick, introducing <cite>Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun</cite>: <i>Looking forward to this one.  I spent
years touring with a fellow - nice guy, wonderful writer<span class='dashes'> —</span> but he was greedy about hitting the
gong. Tonight I get my chance!</i></p></blockquote>
<p>The highlights were just what you’d expect: <cite>Astronomy Domine</cite>, <cite>Fearless</cite>, <cite>If</cite>, <cite>Set the
Controls</cite>, <cite>One of These Days</cite>.  Then there was this other tune, not that loud, no vocals,
and a lovely familiar bass line, but I couldn’t place it. The setlist gave it away: <cite>Atom Heart Mother!</cite>  Of course, when
you take away the string section, the horn section, the choir chanting in Basque (or maybe Swahili or Ojibway?), and the lyric
soprano, it can't be quite the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>Guy Pratt, before <cite>Nile Song</cite>: <cite>Let’s play some dumbass rock&amp;roll!</cite> After: <i>We were
setting up for a David Gilmour tour, and he asked us for song suggestions. I suggested</i> Nile Song<i>, and he suggested I
find another band. So I have!</i></p></blockquote>
<p>There was a nice tribute to Syd Barrett by way of a performance of <cite>Vegetable Man</cite>, never performed live by anyone
before this tour.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick: <i>That sounds unfinished, maybe Sid came to an end before the song did.  But none of this would’ve happened if it
hadn’t been for him, you know.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Both my kids were rockin’ and rollin’ in their seats, particularly on the closing charge through <cite>One of these Days</cite>,
which works really well live with a lot of heavy guitar.  That made me smile.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gary Kemp: <i>I went and saw Pink Floyd at Wembley Stadium when I was (sorry, Nick) only fourteen, they were playing
<cite>Dark Side</cite>, and I found that I couldn’t stop looking at Nick drumming.  Well, to be fair, he was the only person in the
room who was moving.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve always loved <cite>Set the Controls</cite> and I loved hearing it live; the performance wasn’t like any of the recordings
I’ve heard, and no, I wouldn’t say it was <em>better</em> than either the <cite>UmmaGumma</cite> or <cite>Live at Pompeii</cite> takes, but it
was different and fresh and that tune, it’ll be going through my head for weeks.</p>
<p>But what hit me the hardest was <cite>If</cite> (“If I were a swan, I’d be gone”) which they dressed up with a big high-drama
middle-section instrumental.  And its closing line speaks directly to me.  As I edge into old age, speech becomes more effortful. The
inside of my head is a comfy albeit cluttered place to be, and a lot of the things I might want to say would require too much
explanation to be easy. But silence is; too easy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>If I were a good man<br/>
I’d talk with you<br/>
more often than I do.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>For many years I’ve interacted with my fellow humans, I think perhaps more than any other way, via the medium of Internet chat.
But in my chat window, they’re fading, one by one. This problem is technical and personal and I felt it ought not to go unrecognized.</p>
<img src="Adiumy.png" alt="Adiumy" class="inline" />
<p>Since forever I’ve used a chat client called
<a href="https://adium.im/">Adium</a>; it’s open-source, has a good, polished, flexible UX, and is self-updating. The people I
talked to, some of them were on AIM, ICQ, on various flavors of Jabber and XMPP and then, in latter years, Google+.
What’s happening is, they’re going away.  The chat connections I mean, although many of those underlying services are winking out
too, one by one.</p>
<p>(That’s the Adium mascot, “Adiumy”, on the right.)</p>
<p>For those to whom those terms “Jabber” and “XMPP” are new, they represented the idea that any chat service should be able to talk
to any other chat service, so you could use whichever you liked best, and hang with your friends wherever on the Net they hung their
chatty hats.</p>
<p>There was a time when commercial chat services supported XMPP because it was felt to be the right thing to do.
But that was old-school hippie thinking, because if chatterers can just go ahead and talk to anyone anywhere,
then <em>your</em> service probably won’t go viral and how are you going to monetize?  You can simultaneously think markets are
a useful civic tool and recognize obvious, egregious failures.  So the links were severed and a whole lot of services just died.</p>
<p>At one point, my Adium typically listed literally hundreds of people I might choose to talk with, with a red or green “available”
glyph; they were grayed-out of they weren’t signed in.</p>
<p>These days, more and more are always grayed out, because they were on some other service that’s no longer connected.  It makes me
sad, because I can no longer say “Hey, qq?” when I want to. So I thought I’d cut and paste some of those people. The world being
what it is, chances are there are lots that I’ll never chat with again.</p>
<p>So I’m going to tour through maybe 1% of the names in my chat window, for its own sake and to say I haven’t forgotten.</p>
<p>The top of the Adium window just now, only two people currently showing logged-in and available.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Green.png" alt="Phipps and Sharpe" />
<p><a href="https://meshedinsights.com/">Simon</a>, long time open-source maven, is an important figure in my life. In 2004, when I ejected from a failing startup and was
wondering what to do, Simon reached out and said “How about coming to work for Sun? You’re interesting because you’re a blogger.”
I haven’t the vaguest how my life would have turned out if he hadn’t.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucesharpe/?originalSubdomain=ca">Bruce’s</a> life and mine have run roughly parallel since
1973 or so; we were students at the University of Guelph; I was a little ahead and marked his papers. Then he got mixed up in
technology and markup and eventually XML and hired my wife, and now we hang out together a bit in the Vancouver Electric Vehicle
Association. Life is weird.</p>
<p>Let’s move into the territory of people who are still signed on, but not in chat mode.  On current trends, they’ll be graying out
soon.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red1.png" alt="Nottingham, O’Grady, Yugui" />
<p><a href="https://www.mnot.net/">Mark</a> is a pillar of the net, has done as much as any other human to keep HTTP’s design and
specification coherent over the last couple of decades.
<a href="https://sogrady.org/">Steve</a> is an analyst with a baseball cap, and knows really a lot about the Internet biz.
<a href="https://blog.yugui.jp/about">Yugui</a> I hardly know<span class='dashes'> —</span>  for a long time she was the
Ruby release manager, and has her fingerprints all over the language’s ecosystem.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red2.png" alt="Gregorio, Hardt, Rohit, Markes, Meier, Mueller" />
<p>Now there’s a list.
<a href="https://bitworking.org/">Joe</a> is a technologist and evangelist.  Dick was a long-time pillar of the Vancouver tech
scene, I worked for him as a consultant once and dueled with him over hiring talent on others, now he’s a fellow Amazonian.
Rohit is one of the most social humans on
the planet and at one point the FoRK (Friends of) list was a force to be reckoned with in the Valley. I
<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/07/RohitSmruti">went to his wedding</a>.
<a href="http://www.kevinmarks.com/">Kevin</a> has fought many standards crusades, most notably microformats; a person who cares
deeply about keeping the Net working.
<a href="https://blog.radioactiveyak.com/">Reto</a> preceded me on the Android DevRel team at Google, and taught me a whole lot
about advocacy, how to do it with integrity and sanity.
<a href="https://twitter.com/pythondj">Diane</a>, whom I’ve known along multiple axes, lives in a nice part of the world and wears a
red hat these days.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Red3.png" alt="Cooper, Enebo" />
<p>Ahh,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danese_Cooper">Danese</a>, she was doing Internet advocacy almost before there was an
Internet. As a Microsoftie, she had to file a special ticket to get a specialized team to get her set up so she could get real
Internet Mail, and nobody else there could understand why anybody would want such a thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.enebo.com/">Tom</a> is a Rubyist, we hired him and Charles Nutter at Sun in the mid-two-thousands. He takes
good pictures too.</p>
<p>Now we’re moving into the grayed-out territory, and I’ll take a quick tour through the alphabet; I manage to hit almost every
letter.
You might recognize some of the
names.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/A.png" alt="Aitken" />
<p>She was close to my ex-wife decades ago, then a development manager at the University of Waterloo; I liked her a lot but we’ve
kind of lost touch.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/B.png" alt="Berners-Lee" />
<p>You might have heard of this guy.  Back in my W3C days, we drank like Churchill; not heavily but steadily. Tim’s always been on
the right side of the important issues.  He and I (and Jobs and Gates) were all born in the same year.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/C.png" alt="Cantrill" />
<p>Taught me a whole lot about how the people who build kernels and filesystems think about them.  He’s exhibited a regrettable
tendency to JavaScript at certain times, but builds wonderful things.  I think we’re competitors now.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/D.png" alt="DiBona" />
<p>Chris sat for many years at the heart of Google’s culture and was a voice for sanity in a place that needed a whole lot more of
it.  Maybe he still is.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/E.png" alt="Enns-Bray" />
<p>My nephew!  Got his Ph.D. at ETH in Zürich in some scary combination of medicine and technology and is now making a living with
it, still in Switzerland.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/F.png" alt="Faulkner, Ferraioli" />
<p>Sally’s a dear friend, does hospitality in Melbourne, we see her every other year, more or less. Julia’s been in Google DevRel,
exhibiting courage and grace while she’s fought an endless struggle with the kind of health issue that renders the medical
profession alternately helpless and counterproductive; I admire her immensely.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/G.png" alt="Gilbane" />
<p>There was a time when Frank was maybe the single most influential person in the world of publishing technology.  I think he’s
still working on it.  I was briefly editor of <cite>The Gilbane Report</cite>; I still remember a huge lifesaving lunch he bought me when a
series of travel/schedule breakages meant that I’d not managed a square meal in two successive days.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/H.png" alt="Hackborn, Hanley" />
<p>Dianne is maybe the most accomplished software engineer the world has never heard of, buried in the bowels of Google. She was
super helpful when I was trying to figure out how to be a voice for Android at Google.  Dervala is a lovely person whose writing I
worship, even though she only blogs  annually these days.  Stop what you’re doing and go read
<a href="https://dervala.com/">The Wishing Chair, 2018</a>; you’ll thank me.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Hoffman.png" alt="Hoffman" />
<p>This one frosts my socks; I’ve worked with Paul quite a bit and like him a lot and our chat linkage is irremediably broken behind
some fucking XMPP SNAFU that I’m not smart enough to figure out and fix.  He helps build the Internet.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/J.png" alt="Janssen" />
<p>Stephen invented the various Devoxx-related conferences and has done a fine job, contributing to the structure of the software
commmunity.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/K.png" alt="Kilmer, Kimber" />
<p>Rich is yet another Rubyist, lots of them in this episode; I miss being part of the Ruby family, it’s a fine place. Eliot was
one of the original XML posse; we disagreed about almost every issue in the design of XML, but I never doubted his integrity or
intelligence.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/L.png" alt="Leung" />
<p>We hired Ted at Sun as another smart tech blogger; we also have photography in common.  I got to know him and his family pretty
well in the first blog-centric social-media surge, and thought a lot of them; I hope that family is still intact and hanging in.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/M.png" alt="Mansfield" />
<p>Here’s another long parallel path.  Phil was one of the inventors of SVG so I first met him in a standards context.  Then our
sons were on the same soccer teams (they still hang out sometimes) and our families became friends. But geography has intervened and we
hardly see them any more.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/N.png" alt="Nicol" />
<p>Gavin was doing magic with XML before there was XML.  An eclectic and determined guy, I miss him. LinkedIn suggests he’s still in
tech.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/O.png" alt="O’Reilly" />
<p>Another name you might recognize; deserves credit for some of the nicer flavors you find in geek culture.  The second O in
“FOO” stands for O’Reilly.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/P.png" alt="Pilgrim" />
<p>There was a time when Mark was maybe the most interesting person on the Internet.  He disconnected with a bang, which decreased
the value of the Net but may have saved his life.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Q.png" alt="Qhin" />
<p>“The Barefoot Programmer” and that’s not just figurative, I’ve seen him shoeless in situations that most reasonable people would
consider unreasonable. Always on the right side of the issues.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/R.png" alt="Ridley" />
<p>I hardly know Michael but we hung out a bit when he was head librarian at the University of Guelph and I was re-acquainting
myself with the place; he never failed to charm me.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/S.png" alt="Schonbrun, Schwartz, Scoble" />
<p>Bill and I gave it our best shot at a startup but didn’t quite make it. I went to his wedding and miss him, although last time we
spoke, he had the misfortune of being an Oracle employee.  Randal Schwartz is a geek’s geek, just type his name into any search
engine and prepare to be entertained. We’ve been on a cruise ship together, twice!
And then there’s the Scobleizer, perhaps the canonical example of a life lived
online. You can’t imagine what it was like in 2004-2005 when he was Microsoft’s Blogger and I was Sun’s and every word we wrote
mattered.  And did we ever write a lot.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/T.png" alt="Thomas" />
<p>This is of course PragDave; I don’t know anybody in the world more accomplished at writing about software.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/U.png" alt="Udell" />
<p>Jon, another master of the life online, has spotted a whole lot of technology trends before anyone; it’s never wrong to read what
he writes.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/W.png" alt="Waite, Wardley, Weinberger" />
<p>Mandy is special to me because she represents the first time, as a member of a Google hiring committee, that I got to be part of
hiring a Googler. Great fun online, and you just can’t get any more eclectic.  Simon’s presence online is massive and he seems to be
right about everything even if I never quite grasped his mapping method. David and I go back to 1990 or so, and he taught me how
best to use stories in a business context; this blog certainly wouldn’t exist without his influence.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/03/11/Y.png" alt="Yamazaki" />
<p>Fumi is a delightful person, the very model of a modern advocate, bridging the Pacific between Tokyo and Mountain View without
apparent effort. Never boring.</p>
<img src="Z.png" alt="Zawodny, Zeldman" />
<p>Another couple of pioneers of the medium which you are now consuming; Jeremy was blogging <em>way</em> before blogging was cool.
Jeffrey was designing websites before almost anyone knew what they were; he and I had way too much fun back in the
days of the Web Standards Project, saying unspeakable things in public, but they were necessary things too.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Not blaming the Net</h2>
<p>The fact that I’ve lost touch with so many of these people isn’t a technology problem, it’s me, me and the times we live in.
Among the clear and present dangers to our way of life, once you get past Global Warming and deranged chiefs of state, the
atomization of the social fabric is high, high on the list. I haven’t fought hard enough to stay connected (not alone in that). And
time grows short.</p>

<p>They come early, purple and gold harbingers of spring. Traditionally I have celebrated them in this blog space.  But that nearly
didn’t happen this year, for reasons that are obvious in the picture.</p>

<p>They’d just come up when we got snow, which then in mid-February kicked off an extended cold snap, many nights hitting -5°C or
below, and the daytime highs rarely topping +5°.  So those little guys are survivors. They’ve lived under snow, with more
shoveled on top (they grow by the sidewalk), and they’re still here.  I had to pick and choose my photos because lots are kinda
beat-up looking.</p>
<p>The traditional season for Thanksgiving is fall; of having harvested and being ready for winter. I’ll be honest, my gratitude peaks
right about now with the first flowers’ arrival. The meteorologists say the Arctic air mass is breaking up and pretty soon the
garden’s color palette will expand.</p>

<p>What happened was, Lauren said “My friend Leonard from choir has a friend whose husband died, and she’s wondering what to do
with his record collection.” I said “If she doesn’t want to try to sell them, I’ll have a look at them.”  Then I took off on a
business trip. When I got back, Lauren said “You need to bring the records in from the van.” There turned out to be 900.  This is
the start of a story of musical discovery.</p>
<p>They turn out to be almost all classical, where the exceptions are cheesy-looking pre-Rock pop music.
I think this piece will anchor an “LP Log” blog series in which I touch on the LPs’ payloads  as I (slowly) work through the
vinyl backlog. Also, as the picture below makes clear, I may have to do a bit of furniture shopping because it’s not as though I
have enough shelf space for more than a small fraction of these.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/IMG_20190119_133007.png" alt="Cat walking around on 900 used LPs" />
<div class='caption'><p>Cat for scale.</p></div>
<p>Just a couple of weeks before, I’d noticed that the old
<a href="https://www.linn.co.uk/">Linn</a> cartridge on my lovely
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/04/Record-Player">Simon Yorke “Series 9”</a> had crapped out.  I can’t complain, it had served
me well and it was at least fifteen years old.
So I needed a new one and,
since I was staring at 900 probably-not-that-pristine records in the face, something to restore &amp; rejuvenate them.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Record cleaner</h2>
<p>A survey of the audiophile press suggests that the cleaners from
<a href="https://www.vpiindustries.com/">VPI</a> offer a good price/quality combination.  The
<a href="https://www.vpiindustries.com/hw165">VPI HW 16.5</a> looked good but hard to buy in Canada, until I
visited eBay, where they seem to appear regularly. It’s at least a decade since I bought anything at eBay; they seem to be
getting along without me. I missed out on a couple of auctions but eventually scored, probably
paying a little too much, jumping the bid by $50 in the closing seconds.</p>
<img src="VPI-HW-16.5.png" alt="VPI HW 16.5" />
<p>Cleaning LPs with the machine is just massively cool.  First you screw the record down, spin up the turntable, and slather it with
cleaning solution (20% isopropyl).  Then you hit the vacuum switch and a hollow
cylindrical arm with velvety brushes comes down on the disc and sucks the fluid right back in.  Two revolutions of the turntable are
plenty.
It’s pretty remarkable to see an LP go on looking grungy and dim, and come off gleaming.</p>
<p>There are lots of videos on YouTube, but in most of them the actual action shot is embedded in a lengthy “review”.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HnNNfGoqFI">This one</a> is blurry and shaky but gets right to the point.</p>
<p>The guy in the video uses a specialized record-cleaning brush.  I didn’t have one in that style, so used a standard
super-soft-bristle paintbrush and that works fine.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The cartridge</h2>
<p>High-end audio is bloody expensive, and I have never previously purchased a component without listening to it, playing music of
my own that I know and love.  With the exception of cartridges; dealers are understandably reluctant to keep lots of tiny fragile
objects in stock and let customers drop them on their own crappy vinyl.  So it was a matter of reading reviews.  Boy, are there ever
a lot of cartridges out there.  One decent survey is the long-running <cite>Recommended Components</cite> published twice yearly by
<cite>Stereophile</cite> magazine. Check out the Fall-2018
<a href="https://www.stereophile.com/content/recommended-components-fall-2018-edition-turntables-tonearms-cartridges-etc">Turntables,
Tonearms, and Cartridges</a> section.</p>
<p>Ordering high-end online doesn’t seem to be much of a thing so I got a local retailer, Vancouver’s
<a href="https://hificentre.com/">Hi-Fi Centre</a>, to order it in. The store is really a super pleasant place to visit.</p>
<img src="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/23/IMG_20190220_123243.png" alt="The Hi-Fi Centre in Vancouver" />
<p>My conversation with the guy there was a little sad.  It’s a nice place, they seem to be doing well, but their customers are
mostly over 50.  I may be among the last generations to care enough about audio quality to do this sort of this stuff.  For most
people these days, a Sonos or an Amazon Echo or whatever that brings tunes to where they are will do the job.  Me, I hope to spend
a few more years of evenings sitting up late in a comfy chair with a small adult beverage, spinning the discs and listening,
<em>really listening</em>, to them.</p>
<p>After a lot of grinding back and forth and looking for second opinions on the net, I settled on the
<a href="http://www.dynavector.com/products/cart/e_20x2.html">Dynavector DV-20X2</a> (low-output option), made (by hand, they say)
in Japan.  My reasons: The price
was within the bounds of sanity.  It’s been described as easy to set up. Relative to many other good cartridges, it has
relatively high “compliance”, which means it should be easier on the records, most of which are totally irreplaceable. Finally, a
couple of reviewers said it did a great job on rock &amp; roll.  Yes, I know I have 900 classical records to consider, but I also know
where my heart lives.  Here it is, in action.</p>

<p>Getting it set up was a major pain in the ass. I couldn’t turn up the original turntable documentation, but
fortunately, it’s a major enough issue that there were two different places out on the net that talked through the process. It
doesn’t help that I have shaky hands and am at best modestly dextrous.  If Simon Yorke comes to read this (he’s retired but I think
still living): It’s a great turntable, Simon, but getting the vertical tracking angle right is <em>awful</em>!  If Lauren hadn’t
helped I never would have managed.</p>
<img src="Dusty_in_Memphis.png" alt="Dusty in Memphis" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-3'>Dusty!</h2>
<p>Finally, it was all tightened down and the wires plugged in.  For the turntable’s first outing, I put on a pristine copy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_in_Memphis">Dusty in Memphis</a> that I’d bought but never played after discovering
that my cartridge was busted.</p>
<p>Oh. My. God. Should have upgraded the cartridge years ago.  If you haven’t heard good vinyl on good hardware I really don’t have
any words that I think will convey the experience.  I mean, it helps that at that moment in 1969 Dusty had cosmic mojo, fabulous
producers, and took on a list of classics.  I guess the most famous would be <cite>Windmills of Your Mind</cite>, but there are
plenty more jewels.</p>
<p>Also, it’s a production triumph. The arrangements are cool, the musicians are razor-sharp, and the recording is just slightly on
the dirty side of pristine, which is exactly what you want; it really does that thing that vinyl is (in my mind) a little better at
than digital<span class='dashes'> —</span> creating the illusion of a bunch of musicians down at that end of the room.</p>
<p><i>     When you knew that it was over, you were suddenly aware<br/>     that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of his hair.</i>

<p>Herewith notes from the white-hot center of the Internet software profession. Maybe the reality these reflect prevails across
other technology territories, but I wouldn’t know.  In no particular order:</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Videoconferencing</h2>
<p>Generally it sucks. There’s Skype ’n’ TeamViewer ’n’ Zoom ’n’ Webex ’n’ our own
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/">Chime</a> ’n’ GoToMeeting ’n’ join.me and they all suck in their own unlovable idiosyncratic
ways. The visual glitches I can tolerate, but the audio problems make me want to scream; dropouts, static, echoes, the noise of
hands softly leafing through a document drowning out any non-booming voice.</p>
<p>In my decades-long career, I’ve used one videoconferencing system that was reliable and almost always Just Worked. It was by
Polycom, but then the infrastructure people said “super old school” and replaced it with something modern that often doesn’t. I
suspect darkly that the technology is passable but a bean-counter somewhere has refused to buy enough bandwidth to make it sing?
Blecch.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Screens</h2>
<p>The amount of screen real-estate per geek grows monotonically. Dual-27" screens plus your laptop’s own screen are table
stakes, and I’m seeing the occasional massive 50"-plus 4K screen. I asked one guy
“How can you <em>use</em> all that space?” He said “I can’t of course, all the stuff I’m actively working on is in the middle third,
bottom half. But having everything else within visible reach is such a win.”  OK then.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I’m becoming increasingly conscious that the pixels on my
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2016/02/24/Dell-U3415W">curved 34" Dell U3415W</a> <em>are</em> in fact visible,
and the contrast between that and my Retina laptop screens is a perceptible irritant. #FirstWorldProblem.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Desks</h2>
<p>The proportion that are motorized is higher every quarter.  I’d find it hard to live without mine.  The mix of people standing
and sitting makes the otherwise-dreary rows of software-engineer desks a little easier on the eye, which welcomes disorderly human
distributions.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Office space</h2>
<p>Since I mentioned it: All the high-tech companies I’ve worked for have resolutely ignored the research I hear about that seems to
say putting expensive engineers out on the floor with no separating walls leads to grievous productivity losses. Isn’t this biz
supposed to be data-driven?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Diversity</h2>
<p>We do
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2019/02/09/D-and-I-training">work on the problem</a>, but the gender ratios are still not good.</p>
<p>If you can get past that (I can’t) there are grounds for good cheer.  Here in Vancouver we draw from the very considerable
Canadian talent pool, but our immigration law lets us hire major distributed-systems talent from almost anywhere in the
world.
The resulting mix actually makes me feel optimistic about humanity; the AWS Service groups that
surround me offer visible in-the-flesh proof that there’s plenty of software talent in any ethnic, linguistic, or geographic slice
across the membership of <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
<p>I’m amused that when chance lands two engineers on a problem who happen to share a native
tongue, they immediately drop out of English and into Polish or some south-central Han dialect or whatever it is Nigerian
geeks speak to each other.  There’s this one group near me that has three guys named Muhammad; one them is called by his actual name, then
there’s “Mo” and “Momo”. It seems to work, and by the way Momo seems to be the leading expert on AWS Region Build Automation, which
is a big freaking hairy deal around here. Protip to the industry: If you’re not recruiting out of West Africa, you’re missing out on
major engineering talent.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Darkness</h2>
<p>I’m talking about screens. What with the advent of Mojave, light text on a dark background has officially re-entered the GUI
mainstream.  But more or less all the younger engineers had already switched their IDEs over to light-on-dark. My
white-background IntelliJ and Goland screens mark me as a dinosaur.</p>
<p>I’ve cared deeply about typography and presentation for a long
time and the issues here are interesting. I freely acknowledge that my preference for dark-on-light is probably an artifact of my
having tuned my brain, in my youth, to ink-on-paper.  Since screens are, at the end of the day, light-displaying devices, there’s an
argument that the natural on-screen design language for typography and information display is light-on-dark. I wonder if there’s
quantitative research in the space?</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Speaking of IDEs</h2>
<p>I guess the big story is the decline of Eclipse from “more or less everybody’s default” to “there are still people using it”.  VS
Code has momentum
but IntelliJ has a plenty of loyalists, and then the front-end tribe are often in Atom and Sublime.  I’m happy to report that
neither Vim nor Emacs have gone away.  But recently our license server was having problems and I couldn’t use Goland and found the Emacs
go-mode story pretty weak.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Speaking of languages</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that the Internet still runs, more than anything else, on Java. Could be worse, I remember when it all ran on PHP
and Perl. And I don’t want to diss Java <em>too</em> much.  The tooling story is exceptional, and once your JVM gets properly warmed
up, there’s nothing that runs usefully faster. And these days, for new stuff you should spell Java “Kotlin”.  Especially since if
you let those young pups who won’t get off my lawn use Java, they’ll emit all this Java 8+ stream/lambda stuff that is easy to make
indecipherable.</p>
<p>What’s happening out on the front-end frontier, the Cambrian explosion of JS-based technologies, makes me happy that I mostly
don’t go there.</p>
<p>On the back end where I live, we’ve got Go and Rust creeping in big-time. I’m no longer surprised when I pull up some package
buried deep in our serverless infrastructure and it turns out to be in Go. Well, and for serverless code too, if only because of the
fast startup.</p>
<p>If you live in the world of ML or data science, you’re using Python; you don’t have a choice and it’s not
terrible.</p>
<p>Then Rust, for when you get close to the metal.  There was an internal new-languages thread where someone said “If you can’t
tolerate GC, use Rust. Otherwise use Go.”  Sounds reasonable.
A few zealots are saying everything new should be in Rust because otherwise you’re being
wilfullly unsafe. But I like having the runtime manage memory for me, whenever I can get away with it.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Inside the software</h2>
<p>REST is still a really good way to piece pieces of the software world together. Of course, what with the rise of HTTP/2 and QUIC,
what the programmer thinks of as RESTful requests are something quite other, out on the wire.  This feels about like us
thinking we’re using x86 instructions on our silicon even though what the circuits are doing is really totally different.</p>
<p>To the extent that interfaces aren’t REST, they’re mostly event streams of one kind or another. Where by “Event” I mean “JSON
blob”; by and large good enough.  This is the area I’m working on this year, lots of opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>The good news: Each generation of devs that comes along is a little more test-infected than its predecessors.  I still run
across islands of ignorance where they think it’s OK to ship code now and do the unit tests later (as if that ever happens), but
less and less each year.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Which computers?</h2>
<p>Still more Macs than anything else, although there’s an undeniable Windows renaissance. Having said that, even the smart people
with the coolest Surface devices are often bitching about problems with things called “drivers”<span class='dashes'> —</span> what
are those for, anyhow?<span class='dashes'> —</span> and lockups, and saying “Sorry, just a moment while I get my computer going”.</p>
<p>If I were a little less aged and cynical, I’d be boiling over with anger at Apple’s inexcusable stewardship of the Mac franchise;
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/my_2018_apple_report_card">Gruber’s “D” grade</a> is maybe even generous. This is a
product that used to feature instant wake-up (gone), MagSafe (gone), lots of useful I/O ports including SD card readers (gone), a
good built-in photo editor (gone), and the world’s best keyboards (gone). It absolutely shocks me that a company can get away with
making its product successively
worse and then worse again, year after year. Among other things it speaks to how good the core design of MacOS is.</p>
<p>But maybe 2020 is the year of Linux on the desktop?</p>
