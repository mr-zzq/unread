His interest in light painting—a form of long exposure photography that creates colorful images by moving a hand-held light source—started seven years ago, when he came across a tiny section dedicated to the art of light drawing in his newly-purchased digital photography book. ]]></summary>
				<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2019/02/15/painting-with-light/"><![CDATA[<p>From there, Tim began to Google more and more about it, and what started off as curiosity, eventually turned into a passion. The documentary “<a href="https://vimeo.com/21338911">Ball of Light</a>,” on Vimeo, was his first major source of inspiration.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp/33145042210/" title="Firstborn.  50-365 by FadeToBlackLP, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2852/33145042210_c4756f000e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="640" alt="Firstborn.  50-365"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>Tim has done about four 365 projects in the past six years, shooting daily. “Light painting is, for me, the ultimate form of creativity. If you can visualize something in your imagination there will be a way to achieve this with your camera,” he said. But being an experienced photographer didn&#8217;t save Tim from having his 500px account deleted for “posting non-photographing content.” A few weeks ago, the photo-sharing site mistakenly classified his images as “illustrations,” and suspended his (now reinstated) profile without notice. The incident had a positive outcome though. Tim says the media attention gained from the incident has brought light painting to a wider audience. “It’s also a huge compliment from a personal perspective, as I always strive to produce believable work, so I guess I’m doing something right.”</p>
<p>Flickr’s light painting community was another big source of learning for Tim during his earlier days in photography, particularly the shots and conversations in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/lightjunkies/">Light Junkies</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/optical-nirvana/">Optical Nirvana</a> groups. “I’d sit for hours trying to dissect each shot to get my head around how each effect had been achieved. This is what drove me to improve and keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible during that long exposure.” </p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp/31080773044/" title="Event Horizon.  362-366 by FadeToBlackLP, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/31080773044_578b3d221b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Event Horizon.  362-366"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>What’s amazing about his photos is that the majority of his work is done totally in-camera. “I use many techniques and tools to achieve my images, first and foremost is camera rotation. After seeing work by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/twincitiesbrightest/">TCB</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/quornflake/">Dan Whitaker</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lededdie">LED Eddie</a>, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/martinbarras/">Mart Barras</a>, I wondered how they had twisted reality in such a way. Camera rotation was the answer. You place your camera on a rig which allows you to rotate the camera around the axis of the lens.” </p>
<p>Tim uses other techniques, such as refractography or lens and tripod swapping, to achieve that unusual, surreal effect. “More recently <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hugobaptista/">Hugo Baptista</a> very kindly shared a number of 3D cross section videos which are really fun to use. He takes a 3D image and cuts it into cross sections on his computer. He then converts this into a kind of 3D scan that plays on a loop. I play these on my phone whilst rotating or panning my camera, and the original 3D image comes back to life.”</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp/28653108051/" title="Made of Stone.  215-366. by FadeToBlackLP, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/28653108051_f2d3d15273_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Made of Stone.  215-366."></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>Tim, who recently became a brand ambassador for <a href="https://lightpaintingbrushes.com/">Light Painting Brushes</a>, says one of the fun aspects of light painting is the fact that the artist gets to create their own tools, using LED lights, acrylics, holographic cards, and any other tool that reflects or emits light. For beginners, he recommends starting with a few basics: a tripod to keep things steady, a camera capable of bulb mode, a wired or wireless trigger, a bright torch, dark clothing so as to not appear in the frame, and a dark location to allow for long exposures. But, the most important thing, he says, is “to have a good imagination.”</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp/33155216852/" title="Forced Light.  38-365 by FadeToBlackLP, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/671/33155216852_6ffd98439b_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Forced Light.  38-365"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>If you&#8217;re into light painting, be sure to follow <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fadetoblacklp">Tim Gamble</a>. Flickr is where he got started as a photographer. “I love Flickr due to it being the place I found a wider community of like-minded people from around the globe. It also introduced me to my favorite shooting buddy, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fastchris">Chris Thompson</a>, from just over the Pennines in Sheffield. Without his ideas, skills, patience and kind-heartedness most of my favorite light painting images would not exist, and that is all down to a chance meeting on this wonderful platform.”</p>
<p>You may also want to follow the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/lightpaintingcommunity/">Light Painting Community</a> Flickr group, a place where both experienced and beginner light painters can post their photos and share ideas. </p>

<p>When you’re in inspiration mode, scrolling through Flickr, soaking in the incredible shots from photographers around the world, and getting lost in the literal billions of eye-popping, jaw-dropping photographs from your communities, it can feel like a burden to open tab after tab of individual photos just to add them to galleries, albums, and groups. </p>
<p>It was time for a reappraisal of sorts. Organizing all the photographs you find inspiring needs to be easy. Really easy. So we built a new way to add all your favorite content to galleries, albums, and groups in one centralized tool from any photo context on Flickr. </p>
<p>All photos on Flickr, wherever you come across them, will now have a new icon with a + that allows you to access a new menu of actions. When you’re looking at photos from other Flickr members, the + will allow you to add that photo to any of your own galleries or if you’re a group admin, invite the photograph’s owner to add that picture to your group. If you’re looking at your own photos, the + will allow you to add your photographs to any of your albums or quickly submit your photo to the groups you are a part of. </p>

</div>
<p>We’re all about supercharging your Flickr browsing experience and this is just one of many awesome updates we have planned to make organizing and curating your Flickr experience quick and easy. </p>
<p>We’re rolling out the new feature over the next few days, so if you don’t have it yet, hang tight, we’ll release it to you soon. </p>

				<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2019/01/29/top-25-photos-on-flickr-in-2018-from-around-the-world/"><![CDATA[<p>From the billions of photos uploaded to Flickr in 2018, we chose the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157704759025571/">Top 25 Flickr Photos of 2018</a>. Of all the incredible moments captured, we’ve curated a list of the most inspiring photos, which represent a global community of unique perspectives.</p>
<p>To determine top photos, Flickr staff created an algorithm that took into account a number of social and engagement metrics, like how many times the photo was viewed or faved. We made sure to curate the raw data to avoid the results being a popularity contest; we removed spammers and photos that don’t qualify as high-quality. We also tried to ensure diversity of genre. For photographers whose photos placed in the top list multiple times, we selected their top-scoring photo.</p>
<p>We’re proud to present the Top 25 photos of 2018, whose diverse and talented photographers represent 12 different countries around the world.<br />

<p><em>“Father and daughter” by Dan Perez</em></p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/danperezfilms/44684985134/" title="Father and daughter by danperezfilms, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1963/44684985134_8e6e75f225_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Father and daughter"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Photograph of my wife and her ailing father in a nursing home in Puerto Rico. I was standing outside the room just watching when I decided to get my camera and snap a few photographs of them together. Unbeknownst to us all, this trip to visit her father in Puerto Rico would be her last. She passed away due to complications from the removal of a brain tumor three months later. This photo truly illustrates the kind of caring person she was. Her father lives on with a broken heart—she will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Dan Perez is a self-taught, multiple award-winning documentary filmmaker, photographer and overall nice guy. He was raised in NYC and now calls South Florida home. His films have screened at film festivals in 15 different countries and his photography work has been recognized and awarded by the Photographic Society of America and selected in several international photography competitions and exhibitions. Dan specializes in documentary, photojournalism, live music, and travel photography.</p>

<p><em>“Walking the Line(s)” by Paul Brouns</em></p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brouns/26965401687/" title="Walking the Line(s) by Paul Brouns, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/975/26965401687_b0eac7d382_b.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" alt="Walking the Line(s)"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Somewhere in Amsterdam, I noticed these horizontal coloured lines near the entrance area of a building. Instantly recognising this to be an ideal subject, I decided to wait for someone to walk by the wall, in order to get an extra point of reference. In the end, a small dog appeared to be just what I needed to match the composition perfectly.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Paul Brouns is an artist and graphic designer, living near Amsterdam in Holland. Rhythm, color, and geometry are recurring themes in his photographic work and architecture has proven to be an ideal subject for this. He’s attracted to abstract, rhythmic expressions of buildings and tries to visualise that as purely as possible. He believes that no matter how the work is made (direct photography or advanced image editing), what counts is the creation of a feast of dancing shadows, sunlit reflections or color combinations that enchant and inspire the viewer.</p>

<p><em>“Swan Lake” by Volker Woll</em></p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/69361287@N04/43236091630/" title="Swan Lake by v-_-v, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1922/43236091630_79e1bc3cb9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Swan Lake"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “‘The swan in South Tyrol, Italy’ [‘Swan Lake’] is one of my favorite images because it started out as a fail. Originally, I wanted to photograph a different location, but learned the day before that the road was closed and I couldn’t get there. So I spent the rest of the day scouting the area and finally found this lake called Lago di Dobbiaco that seemed to have potential for a sunrise shoot the next day. This morning, all the pieces fell into place for me: the low hanging clouds, the bit of color from the rising sun, the mist over the lake and the reflection on the calm water&#8230;Believe me when I say, I had to talk that swan into posing for me&#8230;Thanks again, Swan. It&#8217;s these (rare) moments that make up for all the other more common moments when the pieces did not fall into place.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> When he’s not out travelling and taking photos (which is the majority of the time) Volker Woll is living in southern Germany working on software. Funny enough, he met other IT people on those many sunrise shoots (like in “Swan Lake”), so he thinks that landscape photography and software development are just two different shades of nerdy.</p>

<p><em>“Lonely alleys of Venice” by ines_maria</em></p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/125216791@N07/27084478928/" title="...lonelyalleysofvenice... by *ines_maria, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/803/27084478928_596b191b30_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="...lonelyalleysofvenice..."></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “I arrived by train to Venice in the very early morning—it was freezing cold. I strolled through the streets, the lights were still on in some homes and businesses. After turning into a side alley, peace and an eerie silence spread—it was just the kind of moment I always hope for: in this case, the feeling of loneliness, the dark abandoned silence. Suddenly, quietly, and slowly, these men appeared and disappeared. I knew this was the story I’d been longing to capture.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Ines Maria lives in Vienna and works as an art director at an advertising agency. As a self-taught photographer, her love and passion, as you can imagine, is photography. She believes humans contrasted with our artificial environment (streets and architecture) is a beautiful expression of photography.</p>

<p><em>“Natasza” by Krzysiek Śliwaq</em></p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/124055761@N02/45454646581/" title="Natasza by Me an Atheist (Krzysiek Śliwaq), on Flickr"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1907/45454646581_3096fdb526_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Natasza"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>How this moment was captured:</strong> “Natasza’s portrait is an example of one of my visions that I have somewhere inside—a simple, classic, close portrait with a bunch of natural emotions enriched by my own patterns of post-processing. Here, I used a dark mood and black and white tones to enhance the perception of her beautiful face, big eyes, and cute freckles. Ambient light made natural and delicate reflections in her eyes and mild skin facture. I tried to catch natural hands setting in the frame as well to make the portrait complete.”</p>
<p><strong>The photographer:</strong> Krzysiek Śliwaq was born in 1984 in Poland. He is a solution designer and an enterprise architect in the IT sector working for an international company. He’s a happy husband and a fulfilled father of two remarkable children, who in his free time, takes portraits of young people and sometimes conducts original portrait photography master classes. In his pictures, he’s looking for the real and non-obvious emotions and mood. Krzysiek believes his works are largely a fusion of classic portrait, fashion portrait and fine-art combined with the real charm and authenticity of a child, and with a pinch of dark and intense mood. He enjoys dealing with the two extremes—rawness, naturalness in the message and widely considered in a portrait photography—fine-art. The 80s and 90s, when he was growing up, certainly had a huge impact on his art perception, and he still considers himself to be a big fan of music and cinematography from those times.</p>

				<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2019/01/16/celebrating-the-11th-anniversary-of-flickr-commons/"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the 11th anniversary of The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons">Commons</a> &#8211;  a project that Flickr began to provide cultural institutions, such as libraries, museums, and historical societies, with a space to share their digital collections with people around the world. </p>
<p>The Commons was launched on January 16, 2008, when Flickr released its <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/01/16/many-hands-make-light-work/">pilot project</a> in partnership with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress">The Library of Congress</a>. The two main objectives of the program were to increase discovery and use of publicly-held photography collections and to provide a way for the general public to contribute knowledge through user-generated content (by adding tags, comments, and notes to these historical collections).</p>
<p>In honor of the tremendous growth of this now-11-year-old project, and the 115 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/commons/institutions/">participating institutions</a> that have joined so far, we&#8217;ve created a gallery featuring the images from the Library of Congress (and other Commons member accounts) with the highest number of community-generated tags. Check out the full gallery <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/flickr/galleries/72157677774809898/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a sneak peek.  </p>

<p>With 70,400 followers and 33,021 photos uploaded to Flickr, the Library of Congress continues to be one of the largest and most active accounts from The Commons catalog. To celebrate, they are sharing 11 photos related in some way to the number 11 to a new Flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/albums/72157675635280157">album</a> focused on the 11th anniversary of The Commons.

<p>Over the years, the Library of Congress has identified and deciphered the story behind many of the images from its catalog thanks to the expertise and research skills of hundreds of Flickr users. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to give a special shout-out to users like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/artolog/">Art Siegel</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/29079609@N02/">Kilted Cowboy</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/21686909@N07/">budderflyman</a>, and many other frequent commenters in the community who have been active on the Library of Congress account for years, helping to flesh out names of subjects and providing historical context. Thank you all for your dedication!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in supporting The Commons, please be sure to join the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrcommons">Flickr Commons group</a>, a place for The Commons community to share and discuss the truly awesome collections being made available in The Commons. </p>

				<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/12/17/important-service-updates-and-dates-to-remember/"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months, we’ve been talking about upcoming changes to both Flickr Pro and Flickr Free accounts. There are a couple very important dates approaching quickly that will affect the features of all Flickr accounts. If you want a quick refresher to know why we’re making changes to Flickr Free accounts and exactly what’s changing, check out this<a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/changing-flickr-free-accounts-1000-photos/"> blog post</a>.</p>
<h1>Important dates</h1>
<p>January 8, 2019: Free accounts will be limited to 1,000 photos and videos. Free accounts with more than 1,000 items will no longer be able to upload new photos or videos.</p>
<p>February 5, 2019: Any items over the 1,000-upload limit will be at risk of deletion, starting with the oldest of the items. Photos licensed through Creative Commons before November 1, 2018 will not be deleted, even for accounts over the 1,000 limit.</p>
<h1>Upgrading to Flickr Pro</h1>
<p>There’s no place like Flickr to share your photos and grow with other photographers. Upgrading to Flickr Pro gives you unlimited storage, exclusive partner discounts (Adobe Creative Cloud, Peak Design gear, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=FLICKRPRO15">and more</a>), increased exposure on Flickr, ad-free browsing, advanced stats, and more. </p>
<h1>Cheers to you</h1>
<p>We’re extremely proud of what the Flickr community has become. It’s still the largest, most influential group of photographers in the world, and has contributed so much to how photography has grown and changed over the years. That’s one of the reasons we’re keeping a strong <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/12/14/photography-and-licensing-qa-with-creative-commons-ceo-ryan-merkley/">partnership with Creative Commons</a>. Since we value accessibility to quality photos, we’ve given <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/07/the-commons-the-past-is-100-part-of-our-future/">nonprofits free Pro accounts </a>and encourage all eligible nonprofits to apply by filling out <a href="https://help.flickr.com/en_us/discounts-for-non-profit-organizations-rJio8cn7">this form</a>. We’ve also added the ability to gift a Pro account.</p>
<p>2018 has been a big year for Flickr. We’ve carefully listened to your feedback and we’ve already implemented some exciting changes that will make Flickr a better place to grow—like <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/31/we-cant-stand-spam-either/">de-spamming</a> and <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/29/bringing-heroic-support-to-flickr/">support</a> improvements and plans to improve <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/10/31/putting-your-best-photo-forward-flickr-updates/">photo delivery</a> and <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/leaving-the-yahoo-login-behind/">login</a> experience. We can’t wait to share more updates and new features with you in the new year.</p>

				<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/12/14/photography-and-licensing-qa-with-creative-commons-ceo-ryan-merkley/"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2004, Flickr has been a proud supporter of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, a licensing system that gives photographers and creators the ability to share and distribute their works on conditions of their choice. Today, people can find hundreds of millions of public images released under Creative Commons licenses on our site; we have the honor of being the largest repository of openly licensed works online.</p>
<p>The significance of this massive collection of creative works will always <a href="https://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/07/the-commons-the-past-is-100-part-of-our-future/"> matter to us</a>— and that&#8217;s why Flickr continues to work with Creative Commons on ways to cultivate and grow this long-term partnership. We recently met with Ryan Merkley, CEO of Creative Commons, to talk about common goals, reflect on the history of our communities, and discuss future challenges and opportunities. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kitkit201/45991979121/" title="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-5 by Wilson Lam {WLQ}, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4855/45991979121_5740d762b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-5"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Why is it important for photography platforms like Flickr to support Creative Commons (CC) licenses?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> Because photographers want it. If you want to be a platform that gives its users choice, then CC is the most reliable standard for sharing your work under permissive terms. “All Rights Reserved” is the default for every photo from the second it’s taken, but a considerable portion of users and creators want to share, and a CC license gives them the opportunity to do that. </p>
<p><strong>Allowing CC licenses has helped Flickr grow as a community, to the point that we’ve become the largest repository of CC-licensed images. How has the CC community benefited from Flickr’s support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> A for-profit company [Flickr] every month spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on bandwidth and storage in order to make these images available to every person who wants them, under these terms. That’s a huge gift to the Commons, to history, to the community, to humanity. </p>
<p>Flickr is one of the most, if not the most, important collections of Creative Commons works online. If we lost that, we’d have to move it somewhere and build a platform that could host it, and serve it up in some other way. That infrastructure is really important. We&#8217;ve come to see Flickr as part of the infrastructure of the web, not just a service. It&#8217;s part of the core of what we think of as the “open web.”  </p>
<p><strong>Why do you think so many people choose Flickr for sharing and accessing Creative Commons images?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> I think a huge part of the goodwill that exists for Flickr is tied to this notion that it was built around the ideals of sharing and bringing communities together, so it was more than just a photo platform. </p>
<p>Wikipedia and Flickr are part of this old web that people still love, and it&#8217;s one of the few for-profit companies that has been able to hold those values through sell after sell. That says something about the people that work at Flickr, about the people who purchased Flickr, about the community that stayed with Flickr.</p>
<p><strong>Flickr takes copyright very seriously, but we believe creators should have the choice to decide the type of license and conditions they wish to apply to their work. What would you say to photographers who criticize the Creative Commons because they think it creates a body of work that competes with their ability to make money? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> Creative Commons was designed to give authors and creators choice. In an environment where copyright is the default, every creator has to choose to share or not to share.</p>
<p>If a photographer makes a work and they don&#8217;t want to share it, they shouldn&#8217;t. Creative Commons is not going to come and take their work from them; we never would. We made a set of licenses with different permissions because some photographers were willing to share and only wanted credit, and other photographers were willing to share but also wanted to make sure that they were the only ones who could profit commercially.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kitkit201/45080326275/" title="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-6 by Wilson Lam {WLQ}, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4839/45080326275_e6d8e276ff_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-6"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Do you believe photographers have a good general understanding of the different types of CC licenses they can apply to their work, and the implications of choosing one of these licenses? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> I think photographers, more than most creators, have a pretty good grip on their copyright. I think there are nuances of the licenses people don&#8217;t quite get. People understand that CC-BY means that “I must give credit,” but they probably get stuck on “what does ‘give credit’ mean?” </p>
<p>A piece of the licenses requires some goodwill and good actors, and when you have bad actors, then people need to work it out. But I can say that over seventeen years of the life of Creative Commons, two things have been consistent: when the licenses are under scrutiny and they go to court, the license terms hold up and the rights of creators are upheld. The number of cases where that&#8217;s happened is very few because, most often, people work it out.</p>
<p>The licenses were not supposed to be a big hammer that you hit people with; they&#8217;re supposed to enable collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>We often see examples of people, including journalists, who forget to give proper attribution to the photographer, or give attribution to the platform instead. What has CC done over the years to help creators understand the benefits of using an open license and to educate the public on how to properly attribute and use those CC-licensed works? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> We provide educational materials. We go meet with our partners and do videos in their offices and talk to them about how to do this. In our own products, we&#8217;re building a service called <a href="https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/">CC Search</a>. The idea is to collect all the works of the Commons and provide front-door access to them. We&#8217;ve built one-click attribution as well. </p>
<p>Where I&#8217;d like to get to is a place where attribution is automatic so that the user doesn’t have to do anything. </p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us more about the Creative Commons Search initiative? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> CC Search, when it&#8217;s completed, will be a collection of the catalog of the Commons online—so 1.4 billion licensed works across 9 million different websites, from Flickr, Wikipedia, Youtube…all the way down to someone’s individual blog. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever get everything, but the idea is to collect the majority of that in a catalog that refers to the various places where those works are located. </p>
<p><strong>The European Parliament has recently voted in favor of the Copyright Directive, which includes the controversial “link tax” and “upload filter,” two proposals you’ve publicly criticized. How do you think this directive would affect creators and platforms like Flickr if given final approval in January?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merkley:</strong> The link tax gives a right to publishers to link to their sites and was designed around journalism businesses’ frustration over Google News, based on an assumption that if they can make money out of those links that Google News offers, they would somehow be viable again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve already seen both in Germany and Spain that making laws like that has failed. When, in Spain, Google News shut down their service in response to the restrictions imposed by the government, news websites saw their traffic drop drastically overnight. So whatever advertising those sites were getting from traffic vanished. </p>
<p>The other policy that they would bring in is the upload filtering, which would require every piece of content uploaded to be filtered prior to it being posted. This is meant to deal with what its proponents described as “rampant copyright infringement.” Our sense is that what it mostly does is lock out new players because, in order to do that kind of filtering, you would require AI filters or huge armies of people.</p>
<p>That probably means that only the companies that can afford those filters will have them. And the only companies that have those filters right now are Google and Facebook.</p>
<div class="flickr-embed">
<div class="flickr-image"><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kitkit201/45991980121/" title="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-4 by Wilson Lam {WLQ}, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4905/45991980121_30ae36e9dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Creative-Commons-CEO-Interview-4"></a><a href=""></a></div>
</div>
<p>Though we know there will always be new challenges like those proposed by the European Parliament, we at Flickr will continue to work together with Creative Commons to provide photographers with a safe place to share their photos—however they choose. The landscape of sharing online will continue to change, and we&#8217;ll continue to adapt and collaborate in order to protect this repository of amazing images.</p>

<p>Stats have long been an important feature for the Flickr community. Going beyond the social aspect of photo sharing with mere faves and comments, Flickr stats provide valuable insight about your photos’ performance, views, and popularity. Whether you use stats to understand which of your photos are well-received to improve your photography or you just enjoy getting feedback in data form about your favorite shots, Flickr stats are crucial. </p>
<p>That’s why we’re happy to announce that we’re bringing advanced stats for our Flickr Pros to our mobile apps. Now no matter where you are or what you’re doing, you can grab a quick peek into the performance of your photos right from your mobile device. </p>
<p>To find your stats in the mobile app, tap the “person” icon and scroll right across the navigation until you see that “Stats” heading. We’ll be rolling this feature out over the next few days, so be sure to update to the latest version of the Flickr app. </p>
<p>Stats are limited only to Flickr Pros. If you’re ready to see how your photos stack up, you can upgrade to Flickr Pro for stats, unlimited storage, new 5K display resolution, partner discounts, and more. And if you hurry you can get 15% off your first year. Just upgrade by January 1, 2019.  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/account/upgrade/pro?coupon=flickrpro15&amp;select&amp;utm_campaign=flickr-launch-15&amp;utm_source=Flickr&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=mobile-stats">Learn more here</a>. </p>

<p>You in? <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/yourbestshot2018/">Join the group</a> now and submit your single best shot between December 1, 2018, and January 7, 2019 (for extra time to edit those fabulous New Year photos). The only rule for your submission is that had to be uploaded in 2018—it doesn’t matter when it was taken. We know it’s like picking your favorite child, but you may only submit one photo. Choose wisely!</p>
<p>Throughout December, Flickr staff will curate submissions and share themed galleries. You can count on these photos getting awesome exposure: our favorites from each gallery will be featured on the Flickr blog and social-media channels through early 2019. </p>
<p>Get a head start browsing through your portfolio before submissions open on Dec.1. We’re stoked to celebrate <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/yourbestshot2018/">Your Best Shot 2018</a> with the Flickr community and can’t wait to see your photos!</p>
