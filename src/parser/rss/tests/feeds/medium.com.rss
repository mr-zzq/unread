            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A follow-up to our Q &amp; A with Stephanie Georgopulos and Harris Sockel, editors at Medium who search for great stories on the platform</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KRP-uGnjhRN6n9kZ_KbjtA.png" /></figure><p>Recently, we <a href="https://blog.medium.com/meet-the-medium-elevators-92ab3c47abc8">interviewed</a> Stephanie Georgopulos and Harris Sockel, editors at Medium who work with independent, self-publishing writers on the platform to help their work reach a wider audience. Steph and Harris spoke about the benefits of publishing on Medium, shared a few of their favorite stories, explained how the <a href="https://medium.com/creators">metered paywall</a> works, and gave their advice for writers.</p><p>In response, many Medium writers (and readers) expressed gratitude and excitement about our efforts to “elevate” independent voices on the platform. Many were inspired to self-publish more stories this year and to — in Georgopulos’ words — “focus on finding their voice.”</p><p>We also received some great questions in the responses about how Steph and Harris do what they do, which we answer below.</p><p><strong>How do I make sure my story is seen by Medium’s editors?</strong></p><p>The best way to make sure we see your story is to focus on quality. Our curators use our published <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006362473-Medium-s-Curation-Guidelines-Everything-Writers-Need-to-Know">curation guidelines</a> to review posts for distribution and flag promising ones to us. We’re always searching for great writing that’s hiding beneath the surface.</p><p>When we do find something we love, we reach out to the writer. To make sure you receive our offers to feature your work, check the “Notifications on your stories” box in your <a href="https://medium.com/me/settings">email settings</a>.</p><p><strong>What subject areas do you focus on? How do you decide which stories are featured?</strong></p><p>We’re primarily looking for general interest stories that will resonate with our readers — relevant, authentic, compelling perspectives that help us understand ourselves and the world around us. Within that, there’s a lot of variety. Here are a few of our favorites from the past month, to give you a sense of the range of stories we work on:</p><p>A reflection on the consequences of climate change — and plastic — by writer and comedian <a href="https://medium.com/u/5890e7941a4b">Andy Haynes</a>: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/unpackaging-1b77bb959833">One Nation, Wrapped in Plastic</a>”</p><p>Amazon software engineer <a href="https://medium.com/u/bf71ba35bb4f">Bhavya Kashyap</a> on the narrow definition of engineering perpetuated by coding bootcamps: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/you-cant-build-an-iphone-with-python-ad690e5b2164">You Can’t Build an iPhone with Python</a>”</p><p>Reporter <a href="https://medium.com/u/bf0df4aebaa7">Yuming Fang</a> visited a maternal hotel in California, where women from abroad travel to give birth in the U.S.: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/inside-the-world-of-birth-tourism-4d6e382346b0">Inside the World of Birth Tourism</a>”</p><p>Journalist <a href="https://medium.com/u/7183e221ac5a">Jon Ward</a> on our hyper-polarizing political moment — and how we might be able to come together: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-gravitron-e2820c1d95f3">How to Get Off the Nauseating Thrill Ride of U.S. Politics</a>”</p><p>Poet <a href="https://medium.com/u/e550c175978b">Jessica Semaan</a> on learning to listen to yourself: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/to-become-the-woman-i-am-e09fd6fd9ceb">To Become the Woman I Am</a>”</p><p>A 100-plus-year-old slice of history that contextualizes the world we live in now, by <a href="https://medium.com/u/ea364511a5a9">Catherine Prendergast</a>: “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/what-an-abortion-felt-like-in-1907-10246f91a743">What Abortion Was Like in 1907</a>”</p><p>We are working on expanding our topic coverage and increasing the number of stories we can workshop. We’re planning to go deep on lots of topics including niche areas we know our members are interested in — like cryptocurrency and digital design. A first step toward doing that is hiring more editors. Recently, we posted three open positions: Platform Editors for <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/medium/f18cbfd7-c30e-403d-ada3-9e07a032064a">Politics</a>, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/medium/1a67659c-7b62-4cca-ba59-22734c72da05">Design</a>, and <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/medium/b3b6121e-ea70-46f4-9fb8-99309eb39733">Cryptocurrency</a>. We encourage anyone obsessed with great writing to apply.</p><p><strong>Do you consider stories that aren’t written by writers enrolled in the Partner Program?</strong></p><p>Yes — we review stories by all writers equally, regardless of whether the writer is in the Partner Program. When we find a great story that’s not eligible to be part of our <a href="https://medium.com/creators">metered paywall</a>, we reach out to the writer to ask them to meter it as part of the elevating process. We also encourage them to sign up for the <a href="https://medium.com/creators">Partner Program</a> to earn money based on member engagement. We pay on a royalty model, so stories keep paying off, as long as people are engaging with them. We’ve designed our Partner Program payment system to reward quality, and we’re always adjusting and working to improve that system. So we encourage writers to do the type of work that has lasting value. As our subscriber base grows, we will increase the payouts that go to partner writers (as well as increase our commissioning budget).</p><p><strong>How do you avoid favoritism? How do you make sure you’re promoting diverse voices?</strong></p><p>A few specific parts of our process keep us honest. We review stories and writers at the end of each month to gut check our output: For example, we look at the percentage of recurring writers vs. new writers. (Last quarter, over 70 percent of Elevated stories came from authors we’ve never worked with before.) We also look at supply and demand in the topics our members read most to determine our areas of focus. While taste (or preference) plays a large role in our work, data provides the framework for much of it.</p><p>That’s not to say it informs every decision we make — we believe, at minimum, in using a blend of science and taste — but it does help us prioritize. We have plans to expand this program in 2019 (and beyond), and we hope to explore new areas of opportunity that aren’t necessarily reflected in the data.</p><p>Lastly, we have a curation team of more than ~20 curators based around the world. They do the lion’s share of distributing stories via Topics (which also power recommendations on the homepage and the Daily Digest). Our curators make up a pretty diverse group, representing five continents and a range of backgrounds, from teaching to writing to technology. Their work is set up in such a way that a single curator doesn’t usually review the same writer every time. Our curation system (built by our amazing engineers) supports that work — and ours.</p><p><strong>Do you work with non-English-speaking writers?</strong></p><p>Not currently — but as we scale, we hope we’ll be able to.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=99e62f56714a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/answering-your-questions-for-mediums-elevators-99e62f56714a">Answering Your Questions for Medium’s “Elevators”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>And an invitation to a panel and open discussion</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_hEDASII5u7vgqJ9NH4mYA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/TamMbr4okv4?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ian Schneider</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/@goian?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Dear Fellow D&amp;I Practitioners and Enthusiasts,</p><p>My name is Pema Lin, and I’m the Head of People at Medium. I joined this organization about a year ago, and I’ve had the privilege of working with our employee-driven and cross-functional Diversity and Inclusion Committee whose mission is to increase, promote, and improve diversity and inclusion at Medium.</p><p>We aspire to become a more inclusive and diverse company, but we’ve been working largely in our own bubble, and with mixed results. Some of our initiatives have gone really well. For example our book club has led to great relationship and community building within our organization. Other initiatives have stalled out: figuring out productive ways for the committee to get involved in our recruiting operation.</p><p>Midway through 2018, I started to feel like I had run out of energy and ideas around D&amp;I. I sensed that my fellow committee members were also growing restless: frustrated by our lack of concrete action and results in terms of increasing the diversity of our employee community at senior levels, particularly when it comes to Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latin representation. See our 2018 Diversity Report <a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-the-diversity-report-503dd91c2edd">here</a>. We have the data, but we need to get better at taking action that yields better results.</p><p>There is so much to be gained by reaching out to the broader D&amp;I community, yet we haven’t been tapping into this collective wisdom. During one of our committee meetings, we asked ourselves, “Why aren’t we asking for help? Why aren’t we sharing what we’ve learned with other organizations? Surely others have stories and experiences that we could learn from? How do we reignite our passion and energy around D&amp;I? How do we stay curious when this conversation is so hard?”</p><p>Maybe you’ve felt this same restlessness and isolation at some point in your respective journeys. <strong>We want to hear from you.</strong></p><p>One of my goals for 2019 is to better connect with others who are passionate about diversity and inclusion — people who range from D&amp;I professionals, consultants, researchers, and enthusiast to those who drive change through influence within their organizations (e.g. ERG leads, team members on committees) to share ideas, challenges, and wins, and to learn from each other.</p><p>We’re creating a safe space for smart and passionate people to come together and to ask hard questions, share experiences and insights, and to learn from one another. This will be in the form of an event that we’ll host, and we hope it will be the first of many.</p><p>The Medium D&amp;I Committee is hosting a gathering on <strong>February 13, 2019 at 6pm in San Francisco</strong>. If you are committed to increasing and promoting diversity and inclusion at your company or in tech, in general, we’d like to send you an invitation to join our evening of lively yet judgment-free conversation. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gathering-medium-for-diversity-inclusion-practitioners-tickets-55545575311"><strong>Please reserve your ticket here</strong></a><strong> as soon as possible, as space is limited. </strong>Even if you aren’t able to attend this event, we’d love to be connected. We’ll also make sure to share out any key insights and learnings from our conversations and post those to Medium in future posts.</p><p>The format of the event will be as follows:</p><p>6–6:45 Networking (there will be food &amp; beverages)</p><p>6:45–7:45 Moderated Panel</p><p>7:45–8:45 Breakout discussions</p><p>Thank you all for reading, and we hope you’ll join us.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Pema</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=bd1489f05a1d" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/an-honest-and-open-letter-to-the-d-i-community-bd1489f05a1d">An Honest and Open Letter to the D&amp;I Community</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>2018 Edition</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N-u0fshAxKzms88RzWfGaw.png" /></figure><p>We believe that having diverse perspectives and voices within our workforce is vital for us to offer diverse perspectives and voices to our readers, and the only way to have meaningful diversity at work is to foster an inclusive environment. Diversity for us includes, but is not limited to, gender, ethnicity, race, culture, socio-economic background, religion, age, physical ability, veteran status, country of origin, primary language, sexuality, political preference, education, and family makeup.</p><h3>The Data</h3><p>Every year, we send an optional survey to our staff to gather demographic information and give employees a chance to voice whether they feel our workplace is diverse and inclusive. We sent the survey to staff hired up until November 13, 2018 and the responses are valid as of November 30, 2018. A few notes on the data:</p><ul><li>The survey is anonymous and optional for all employees. Contractors were not included in this survey. In order to capture some of the subgroups of the survey, we cross-referenced survey data with our internal HR data.</li><li>We separate our statistics into tech — which includes engineering, product, and data science — and non-tech, which includes (but is not limited to) marketing, content, operations, human resources, and design. We do not separate the demographics for other functional groups because their small size precludes anonymity.</li><li>Senior employees are defined as individuals who are in one of the top three levels of our six-tier internal leveling system.</li></ul><h3>Who We Are</h3><p>As of November 13, 2018, we are comprised of 98 employees that identify mostly as introverts and ambiverts. We enjoy both outdoor and indoor activities, with a slight preference for staying indoors. Our current employees are based all over the US, with 75% of the company in San Francisco, 15% in New York and the rest working remotely. The largest team is engineering (46% of Medium) followed by Editorial (13%) and Product (11%).</p><h3>Gender</h3><p>The overall gender split for Medium is 39.6% (-0.6 percentage points from 2017) female and 60.4% male. For the tech roles, the split is 31.5% (-6.5pp from 2017) female and 68.5% male, while for non-tech roles, the ratio of female and male employees is even at 50% (+14pp for female held positions from 2017). In senior positions, we have 27.5% (+4.7pp from 2017) of the positions filled by female employees and the remaining 72.5% filled by male employees.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*IfWNVVOnUcitMyHO" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mRTGeQSDBjwNpeWD" /></figure><h3>Race &amp; Ethnicity</h3><p>The current makeup of Medium is 63% of employees that identify as White. That’s an increase of +5pp from the previous year. There are also 24% of employees identifying as Asian, which represents an increase of +2pp from 2017. We have 9% of employees that identify as Black or African American and that’s a decrease of -2pp from last year. Other groups saw a marginal increase of +1–2pp from 2017.</p><p>We do not have any Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx employees at the senior level.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AgFQ6X8nwHSOSWFK" /></figure><h3>Age, LGBTQ+ &amp; Origin</h3><p>There are other areas of diversity that we measure:</p><ul><li>Most of our employees are between 26–30 years old, but there was a decrease of -8pp from the previous year. The company is trending older and now more than 50% of the employees are 31 years and older.</li><li>14% of our employees identify as LGBTQ+, a jump of +4.3pp from 2017.</li><li>Most Medians were born in America but there’s a significant number (45%) of employees that are either immigrants or born of parents that are immigrants.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MltblTnZpD6E4tOQ" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*pi6trHyBDkhxCFqb" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wK5HLnzn_WqBlg59" /></figure><h3>Inclusion</h3><p>We asked employees who they felt should be better represented at Medium. Combining direct answers to this question with free-form comments, 61% of respondents expressed a desire for a more diverse leadership team. Other areas where people felt Medium lacks diverse representation include: race &amp; ethnicity, age, and political views.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*SytbY7TWSIWk59Uk" /></figure><p>The free form comments also capture that as we continue to grow and become increasingly distributed as a workforce, we have an opportunity to ensure better parity around benefits and social events between remote worker and workers in our San Francisco office.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=503dd91c2edd" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-the-diversity-report-503dd91c2edd">Medium: The Diversity Report</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Stephanie Georgopulos and Harris Sockel spend their days searching for great writing on Medium</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dKlhlHWWjIqu4DcMZ86ivA.jpeg" /></figure><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/f86b4ebd8b2a">Stephanie Georgopulos</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/7428661d5cfd">Harris Sockel</a> are editors at Medium who started out using the platform back in 2013, writing and publishing stories that explored the human condition. Now, they work to “elevate” with independent, self-published writers on Medium. Georgopulos and Sockel scour Medium to find great stories they think deserve a wider audience than they may otherwise be getting.</p><p>They reach out to the writer and work with them on improving their piece, then distribute it broadly through Medium’s topics, publications, homepage, emails, and social channels.</p><p>Medium VP, Editorial Siobhan O’Connor explained the various ways that the editorial team <a href="https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887">works with writers</a> — from the commissioned stories in our monthly magazine to exclusive columnists, plus reported features and insightful essays. She also described how we work with writers self-publishing on Medium — and this interview explains that in greater detail.</p><p><strong>Hi there. Can you tell us what you do?</strong></p><p><strong>Harris Sockel</strong>: We’re finding great writers on Medium and working with them to develop their stories to reach a wider audience. Basically, we work to find compelling voices and build relationships.</p><p><strong>How did you begin working at Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Stephanie Georgopulos</strong>: I’ve been writing on Medium since the site was in beta. I built a publication called <a href="https://medium.com/human-parts">Human Parts</a> on Medium back in 2013, and Harris was one of my first contributors.</p><p>About a year in, I needed help managing the number of submissions I was receiving, and I felt that Harris’s writing embodied the spirit of what I wanted Human Parts to be. We met up for a drink and by the time we left, I had my partner. I joined Medium full time in 2016 as a curator, and you can guess the rest from there.</p><p>The majority of the writers Harris and I ended up working with on Human Parts started out self-publishing on Medium as well. What we do now — looking for great writing, and not really knowing what we’re going to find when we arrive at work in the morning — originates with that editorial experience.</p><p><strong>What draws you to this kind of work — collaborating with writers from the platform?</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: There’s a raw enthusiasm from a lot of these writers, who just <em>had</em> to publish these stories, even without confirmation that payment and readers would be waiting.</p><p>I’ve been a freelance writer before; I’ve written things just to make fifty dollars. So, I understand there can be a different energy that goes into something you’re writing for an assignment versus something you’re writing for yourself.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I’ve learned a lot getting to work with experts who write about their industries. Medium is home to doctors, scientists, designers — leaders in their fields. And they don’t necessarily want to be career writers, but they have expertise that’s really valuable.</p><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about what writers get out of self-publishing on Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I think writing on Medium means the opportunity to reach a wide audience without the overhead of creating your own blog. You don’t need a reputation, followers, or any type of pre-ordained cred to write here and find people willing to listen.</p><p><strong>Georgopoulos</strong>: If the Medium <a href="https://medium.com/creators">Partner Program</a> had existed when I was a freelancer, I would’ve had more options. I’ve had lovely relationships with editors, but at the end of the day, they have to commission stories that make sense for their publication and audience. So when writing is your primary income, you have to make choices about which ideas to pursue. And I think the Partner Program means writers don’t have to choose — you can pitch a big, ambitious idea to an editor, and you can also write something for which there is no natural, obvious publisher. You can monetize your killed stories, your tweetstorms . . . Medium’s always been good for writing first and placing later, but now you can get paid, too. I think a lot of us have trained ourselves to write what we can sell to publishers, but when you’re “selling” directly to readers, you can create and respond to your own audience rather than borrowing one. This is essentially what we do on social media already, for free.</p><p><strong>It goes back to the idea that all of our output on digital publishing platforms and even social media websites is a form of work.</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Right. On many sites and platforms, the work you’re doing — there are ads being sold against it. Medium has always been . . . people call it longform Twitter, but I don’t think it’s like Twitter at all. It’s a place to parse things, not just throw them out there and forget about them later.</p><p>I like processing my thoughts through writing without feeling like I need to have something massive to say every single time. Or that I need a news angle just to speak. And I think that’s been a huge problem with the internet, particularly with personal essays. To sell, it always has to be confessional or</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: This huge revelation —</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Your most private thoughts.</p><p>Sometimes it’s okay to find meaning in lightness.</p><p><strong>What’s an example of a story like that? That felt urgent even if it wasn’t timely?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: “<a href="https://medium.com/@kristicoulter/https-medium-com-kristicoulter-the-24-hour-woman-3425ca5be19f">Enjoli</a>” by <a href="https://medium.com/u/28cf82519e71">Kristi Coulter</a>. It’s a very personal (and very funny) essay about getting sober in a culture where everyone seems to be drinking all the time. I remember when I first read it (Steph sent it to me) and it was that feeling of, this is the story that she had to tell, and she’s telling it in her own way — she’s writing it for herself.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: And it led to Kristi getting a book deal — her first book of essays, <em>Nothing Good Can Come from This,</em> was published last summer by Macmillan. It’s pretty heady to go to work everyday not knowing what opportunities it might create for someone else.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fjT6DYcaHsxY4vqYrPBAjA.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>What’s a story that more recently came through that you really enjoyed?</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: There are so many, but “<a href="https://medium.com/s/story/living-in-deep-time-f395dc4b8f56">Living in Deep Time</a>” by <a href="https://medium.com/u/ec52805c38e8">Elizabeth Childs</a> was one I really loved on a personal level. As many women noted during and since, the Kavanaugh confirmation illustrated to women how our culture regards and values our experiences, and frankly, that picture was monstrous. Throughout the trial I read many personal accounts that echoed Christine Blasey Ford’s, a lot of articles making logical arguments about why this confirmation couldn’t move forward. And in the aftermath, when it did, it kind of felt like . . . do our words matter that little? Why even bother? “Living in Deep Time” reminded me why we bother. It reminded me that you can seize power without stealing it.</p><p><strong>Writers are motivated by different things. How do you tailor your approach for each person?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: Every writer is different. Some want to earn money from their work and build careers in writing. Others want to share expertise they’ve gained from working in another industry, so targeted distribution to a niche audience might be more what they’re looking for. The same goes for editing: some writers want to develop a relationship with an editor, and others want to do their own thing. It really depends, and there are all kinds of writers along the spectrum. Our relationships vary depending on the person, their goals, and their work.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the metered paywall.</strong></p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: The stories we work on are chosen for, and funded by, our subscribers, so everything we work on goes behind our metered paywall. We’re an ad-free platform, so we’re less concerned about every piece getting tons of traffic and more concerned with making sure the readers who invest in a subscription are getting value out of that.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I think writers are starting to see that if you put something behind the meter, the work can go much further. It’s also just thrilling, personally, to see how much more engagement a piece can get after it goes through our process. <a href="https://medium.com/u/3e878c7f3f5">Lydia Sohn</a>’s “<a href="https://medium.com/s/youthnow/what-its-like-to-be-90-something-368780082573">What Do 90-Somethings Regret Most</a>?” is a great example. I found that story through our inbound tips line (any writer can send a story to <a href="mailto:tips@medium.com">tips@medium.com</a> — we get to all of them eventually). Sohn is a minister and writer in San Diego, and in the story she describes interviewing her oldest congregants about their hopes, fears, and regrets. It was obvious Sohn came to the interviews with a lot of empathy (and came away with a new perspective on aging). When I found the story, almost no one had seen it. She’s had a lot of success from that piece, and readers got a lot out of the insights in it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZWnvW7A7guMIRJvnq4Pa3A.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>What do you want writers to know about Medium?</strong></p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I want more people to understand that you can get paid to write what you want to write. I don’t think people quite get that yet. And this doesn’t just go for essayists — I’m waiting for more independent journalists and industry experts outside of tech to try it out.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: And I want people to worry less about “what works” and focus on finding their voice. There’s just really no way to skip the line when it comes to that. The stories that hit me hardest are the ones I didn’t know I wanted, and in my experience those resonate because they’re coming from this one-of-a-kind place only that writer has access to. Their perspective. That lifetime that got them here. That’s what I’m looking for in a story. I’m reading all day long, so something really needs to jump out and have an authentic, fresh voice for me to be able to stick with it from beginning to end. There are only so many hours.</p><p><strong>Sockel</strong>: I probably have a thousand tabs open.</p><p><strong>Georgopulos</strong>: Tabs all day long. It’s extremely exciting and refreshing to find that one where you think, “Ah, this is so good.”</p><p><em>We answer writers’ questions in a follow-up post </em><a href="https://blog.medium.com/answering-your-questions-for-mediums-elevators-99e62f56714a"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92ab3c47abc8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/meet-the-medium-elevators-92ab3c47abc8">Meet the Medium “Elevators”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The 18 (Really Good) Stories That Moved Us in 2018</h3><h4>Medium editors share their favorite stories of the year</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7T5dzIRrc4Ek6oK1hcd2nQ.png" /></figure><p>Medium’s had a big year. We’ve found different ways to <a href="https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887">work with writers</a>. We’ve invested aggressively in editorial. And we’ve bridged the gap between platform and publisher.</p><p>Tens of thousands of pieces are published on Medium every day. We also commission hundreds every month. And every month, we also work with hundreds of Medium native writers on their work. All of that is reflected here.</p><p>Picking favorites is never easy. Read on for a small selection of the pieces that inspired us, moved us, and amused us — and sometimes managed to do all three. Many of them even went viral, which, if you look at the list, should make you feel good about our readers, about the internet, and maybe even the world.</p><p>Thanks for being here.</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/greatescape/nuance-a-love-story-ae6a14991059">Nuance: A Love Story</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/1e11a13afbec">Meghan Daum</a></h4><p>I almost missed my flight home when the first draft of this piece turned up in my inbox. In a sweeping, brave personal essay, Daum chronicles how her search for political nuance in an obnoxiously polarized era led her to a handful of thinkers — disdained within her progressive social circle — known as the intellectual dark web. At the same time, she was mourning the end of her marriage and the loss of her intellectual sparring partner. The result is a smart, searching look at Daum’s personal and political evolution. It’s something we can all learn from in these fractured times. It will give you chills, if not make you cry, and it’s why we’re going to be working more closely with this important writer starting in January.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/98ac79723788">Siobhan O&#39;Connor</a>, vice president, editorial</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/@robdelaney_50150/note-i-wrote-all-of-this-except-the-last-paragraph-in-april-or-may-of-2017-6b8f5e702533">I’m on the Bus to Go See My Son at the Hospital</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/6da5486ee164">Rob Delaney</a></h4><p>Rob Delaney’s essay about the illness and death of his son Henry haunts me months after I first read it. Delaney so deftly captures the love a parent has for a child — and the unimaginable, excruciating agony of seeing that child suffer. This is a piece that deserves to be read and remembered. Read it for Henry.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/81cc25b17a8b">Katie Drummond</a>, deputy editor</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/greatescape/extreme-athleticism-is-the-new-midlife-crisis-d87199a18bed">Extreme Athleticism Is the New Midlife Crisis</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/76b6f01d6b85">Paul Flannery</a></h4><p>Paul Flannery is a great sportswriter who has long struggled with depression. In his early forties, after things came to a head, he started trail running, and he kept trail running. In doing so, Flannery discovered a community of people who have responded to midlife crises by tackling increasingly intense physical challenges. The result is a deeply felt and eye-opening piece.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/128f4412835c">Joe Keohane</a>, features director</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J_ORL96rmIlZ8agEKdBJMQ.png" /><figcaption>Illustration: <a href="https://www.michaelhoeweler.com/">Michael Hoeweler</a></figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1">Survival of the Richest</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/881540f516d3">Douglas Rushkoff</a></h4><p>Rushkoff was a techno-utopian before it was cool. He’s also ahead of the curve on seeing how the heady high-tech fantasies we’ve embraced since the beginning of the digital age may curdle into nightmares if we’re not careful. In this piece, which justly went viral, he notes how the Silicon Valley billionaires we’ve been counting on to lead us into the promised land are already making preparations to leave us behind.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/add1db267bed">Aaron Gell</a>, contributing editor</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SRMfPgS3crM0N4rYAf2W0A.jpeg" /><figcaption>Illustration: <a href="http://www.matthuynh.com/">Matt Huynh</a></figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/story/it-was-raining-in-the-data-center-9e1525c37cc3">It Was Raining in the Data Center</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/4f2c96a401a3">everest pipkin</a></h4><p>This is the most fascinating story about data servers I’ve ever read. It is scientifically, psychologically, politically, and emotionally profound.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/f76eccb4be7e">Bethany Heck</a>, head of design</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/the-cognition-crisis-a1482e889fcb">The Cognition Crisis</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/37d529585fbc">Adam Gazzaley MD, PhD</a>; <em>with illustrations by Maria Medem</em></h4><p>The story itself is fascinating and important, and it was an honor to match it with terrific art. Seeing as I’m on the art side of things, I was delighted that Maria Medem’s work added another dimension to the written story; it’s beautifully figurative and visually arresting, and it feels like it might contain a story all unto itself. Of all of the great art we’ve commissioned this year, this has to be my favorite.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/e9fcf1084336">Ryan Hubbard</a>, art director</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IMUgP2yFvW2JFTj9qNfrnA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Illustration: <a href="http://mariamedem.tumblr.com/">Maria Medem</a></figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/story/why-i-chose-to-become-an-american-citizen-now-b1f5f9d9b77d">Why I Chose to Become an American Citizen Now</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/c67cd7f07db0">Sophie Kleeman</a></h4><p>I’m not sure anyone could say what “patriotism” should mean today, in an era defined by divisive rhetoric, a surge in white nationalist violence, so many shootings we could have avoided but didn’t, widening economic inequality — let’s not continue. In this essay, writer Sophie Kleeman probes with refreshing honesty her decision to become a U.S. citizen in 2018 and helps us understand why we keep pressing on. Beneath so much pain, maybe we can see a little hope shine through.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/1ccc714607f0">Damon Beres</a>, senior editor, tech</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/human-parts/story-told-in-apologies-to-my-ex-husbands-ex-wife-a-cautionary-tale-for-cheaters-85491d944de3">An Apology to My Husband’s Ex-Wife, in 13 Parts</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/11a10a01f56b">Maggie Haukka</a></h4><p>There are many ways to exhibit bravery, though some are more celebrated than others. Firefighters? Brave. “The other woman”? Not at first blush. But while women in Haukka’s position are rarely recognized as brave — let alone sympathetic — these apologies to her husband’s ex-wife are honest, vulnerable, and, for this reader, haunting. This spin on an open letter is more than an apology; it’s a painful, public display of humility and regret, a woman eating her curdled just-desserts. Or maybe it’s a modern parable: not on the pitfalls of cheating, but on the consequences of lying to yourself in the name of love.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/f86b4ebd8b2a">Stephanie Georgopulos</a>, lead, platform writers</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/powertrip/confessions-of-a-u-s-postal-worker-we-deliver-amazon-packages-until-we-drop-dead-a6e96f125126">Confessions of a U.S. Postal Worker</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/480f8535b286">Brendan O&#39;Connor</a></h4><p>Over the past two years, the U.S. Postal Service has become something of a political football in the ongoing battle between the Trump administration and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon. It’s hard to know who to root for. But Brendan O’Connor’s remarkable interview with an anonymous mail carrier cuts through that noise and offers a rare — and grim — glimpse into what it really means to deliver the millions of packages Americans increasingly depend on.</p><p>—<a href="https://medium.com/u/abd2f7ec43cb">Michael Zelenko</a>, features editor</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/the-edge-of-adulthood">The Edge of Adulthood</a></h4><p>When my team first told me about this project, they prefaced it with: “Sorry, but this will give you a heart attack, Alex.” We had four weeks to spare, and as managing editor, my job is, at least in part, to make sure that good ideas work—and happen on a schedule. We powered through it: nine reporters, 46 teens, six artists. The most ardent tasks are often the most worthwhile. What we learned is that today’s teens are more fascinating, smarter, and more together than we give them credit for.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/c626e36ed20">Alex Vikmanis</a>, managing editor</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fYA3A_Z5AktapZab9EoGEQ.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CWiXUHVam4q25qcA9COwNA.jpeg" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xLD5xAeI8rklT78l2ZBSTg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Illustrations by <a href="https://www.rickylinn.com/">Ricky Linn</a>, <a href="http://www.malloryheyer.com/">Mallory Heyer</a>, and <a href="https://clairemerchlinsky.com/">Claire Merchlinsky</a></figcaption></figure><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/the-big-disruption/the-big-disruption-36fbed0268cf">The Big Disruption</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/7bcec4b8c02e">Jessica Powell</a></h4><p>Plenty of satirists have something to say about tech culture, but this novel by a former Google executive has the benefit of insider knowledge. A send-up of a major tech company run by megalomaniacs and weirdos, <em>The Big Disruption</em> is both a love letter and a sharp critique of Silicon Valley — insightful in its complaints but also laugh-out-loud funny. It’s also the first book published by <em>Medium</em>, making it extra special to us here.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/42498c276c64">Sarah Begley</a>, senior editor, books</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/366/1*26ftvKhqBKvpDt8Ayy-vIg.png" /></figure><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/story/how-to-eat-the-best-fruit-and-not-the-bad-fruit-af73f4b74d07">How to Eat the Best Fruit (And Not the Bad Fruit)</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/e3ad36b73a3e">Sheree Joseph</a></h4><p>I enjoyed looking for creative ways to help illustrate this piece as our editorial team worked on it. I love the lighthearted tone and how the author intertwined personal moments while being able to give some, well, great advice about eating fruit.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/d61eac1197ee">Eunice Park</a>, assistant managing editor</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/powertrip/inside-the-shadow-clinics-9581f1d13489">Inside the Shadow Clinics</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/ed97be0dfa8f">Maya Kroth</a></h4><p>This piece is a real feat in reporting and storytelling. Crisis pregnancy centers have been around for decades, but Kroth dug into how they’re becoming increasingly web savvy and sophisticated. She spent time in one of these clinics in Georgia—it’s hard to get inside these places—and the result is a nuanced picture of how tensions around abortion are playing out for rural Americans.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/15b7279d9496">Alexandra Sifferlin</a>, senior editor, health</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/story/gen-x-remember-when-men-preferred-hanes-and-you-were-an-uptight-bitch-6ba6db0feb80">Relax Ladies. Don’t Be So Uptight. You Know You Want It</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/d40fea127d88">Anastasia Basil</a></h4><p>“The right side of history” doesn’t happen in history. It happens now, which becomes history. Twenty-three percent of Americans approved of the March on Washington in 1963. Martin Luther King Jr. died with a 75 percent disapproval rating. Today, we’re in the middle of a massive, messy, rapid social shift on misogyny and equality. Which side of now are you on?</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/b83afaaedbba">Matthew Savener</a>, curation manager</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/powertrip/its-okay-to-not-want-a-promotion-1f7bcb98ef6e">It’s Okay to Not Want a Promotion</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/9691d75f05b3">Jean Hannah Edelstein</a></h4><p>A refreshing, wonderfully honest essay on the limits of ambition, the subjective definition of success, and not wanting the things you’re supposed to want. As we head into the goal-setting binge that typically accompanies the start of a new year, it’s a comforting read, and maybe even a quietly inspiring one.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/a3641a6723f2">Cari Nazeer</a>, service and advice editor</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/story/when-they-leave-8eb15cc2ee1f">When They Leave</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/38ba0b5c5397">Sara Benincasa</a></h4><p>I mourned the loss of Anthony Bourdain with the rest of the world, but I didn’t fully process the meaning of his death — and his life — until I read this piece. Sara Benincasa’s essay is a eulogy, a meditation, and a searingly honest reflection on depression, suicide, and mental health. Read it when you need to feel less alone.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/7428661d5cfd">Harris Sockel</a>, editor, platform writers</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/my-so-called-millennial-entitlement-9be84343c713">My So-Called (Millennial) Entitlement</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/f86b4ebd8b2a">Stephanie Georgopulos</a></h4><p>Steph doesn’t just lament about what’s been taken from millennials (digital privacy, home ownership, etc.) or celebrate the strange flavor of freedom that arises with our coming of age in this era. She really gets at the nuanced silver lining that shines at the intersection of apathy, surveillance, political power, economics, hopelessness, and good old-fashioned self-care. It’s an inspiring read for any Millennial who might feel lost.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/6536627ad539">Sophia Smith</a>, editorial producer</p><h4><a href="https://medium.com/s/unrulybodies/the-body-that-understands-what-fullness-is-f2e40c40cd75">What Fullness Is</a> by <a href="https://medium.com/u/d5f6a126e0de">Roxane Gay</a></h4><p>For me, this essay from Roxane Gay offers a mirror, reflecting undiscovered pieces of myself that I have let go unnoticed or perhaps buried too deep. It helped me understand empathy and identity without ever using those words. This is about Roxane’s decision to have weight-loss surgery and her life inside an “unruly body,” but it is also about the emotional hunger of humanity.</p><p>— <a href="https://medium.com/u/d07ce44c4aac">Matt Higginson</a>, partnerships</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e9edd5b655d8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/the-stories-that-moved-us-in-2018-e9edd5b655d8">The Stories That Moved Us in 2018</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>We’re investing heavily in editorial and the Partner Program</h4><p>As many of you have noticed, we’ve been building out a team of editors and curators at Medium over the last several months. This is exciting. Our goal is simple: put terrific stories in front of our readers and, notably, our <a href="https://medium.com/membership">subscribers</a>.</p><p>Writers are motivated by different things, so we work with them in a number of ways. Some writers want to work with an editor, others do not. Some want to reach as many people as possible, others want to reach a targeted, hyper-engaged audience of their industry peers. Some, but not all, want to earn money for their work.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gvvd_S-f0zUjYkpA5CvRZA.png" /></figure><p>So our editorial team is versatile and varied. Some of us are commissioning stories. We have exclusive columnists, like the feminist writer <a href="https://medium.com/u/e40c977f7a17">Jessica Valenti</a> and the longtime tech and media thinker <a href="https://medium.com/u/881540f516d3">douglas rushkoff</a>; we also commission <a href="https://medium.com/s/trustissues/the-lifespan-of-a-lie-d869212b1f62">reported features</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/s/greatescape/nuance-a-love-story-ae6a14991059">essays</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-nuance">explainers</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/s/traveling-while-black">diverse</a> <a href="https://medium.com/s/voices-from-chicago">voices</a> all the time. We just published a whole <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-big-disruption/why-i-left-my-big-fancy-tech-job-and-wrote-a-book-b64c40484774">book</a>. Finally, we really like collections at Medium; they possess an internal logic that’s pleasing to readers (and they’re fun for editors to put together, too). You can find them all over <a href="http://medium.com/collections">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Medium’s business model is designed to serve writers and readers — that’s it.</blockquote><p>In Medium magazine, which debuted in June and has a new theme every month — like July’s <a href="https://medium.com/s/futurehuman">Future Human</a> and October’s <a href="https://medium.com/s/powertrip">Power Trip</a> — we publish stories by journalists and other writers we admire. We also put together topic-based collections, such as <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-crypto-collection">The Crypto Collection</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-edge-of-adulthood">The Edge of Adulthood</a>, or <a href="https://medium.com/s/art-of-code">The Art of Code</a>. Many of these collections contain both commissioned stories as well as great stories by writers on the platform. (<a href="https://medium.com/s/not-another-first-time-story">This one</a> features all writers who self-publish on Medium, and it’s awesome.)</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of our editorial operation is the growing team of editors dedicated to scouring the self-published stories on Medium each day to find expert and emerging voices that we want to share with readers. When we find stories we love, which happens many, many times every day, we reach out to the writer.</p><p>We’ll workshop their piece to varying degrees, as well as giving it a copy edit, production support, and nice art, and then we promote it. Many of these stories also get featured on the homepage and app or included in themed <a href="https://medium.com/collections">collections</a>, where they live alongside commissioned stories.</p><blockquote>When we find stories we love on the platform, which happens many, many times every day, we reach out to the writer.</blockquote><p>Some of those indie writers are in the <a href="http://medium.com/creators">Partner Program</a>, which anyone can join, and when they do, they stand to earn money based on engagement with their work. (What’s especially cool about the Partner Program is that writers can continue to earn cash on a story as long as members continue to engage with it — kind of like royalties.) There are tens of thousands of people in the Partner Program, and we’ve been working with a growing number of them directly.</p><p>Lastly, while poking around Medium, you may have also noticed more <a href="https://medium.com/topic/book-excerpts">book excerpts</a>. We’re excited about these and have a full-time editor finding forthcoming books we think Medium readers will love. (She’s also the editor behind the aforementioned <a href="https://medium.com/s/the-big-disruption">book</a> we published by a former Google exec, whose work, while fiction, reads like a tell-all.) We pay competitively to license these excerpts the same way we would commission a story; we don’t sell placement to publishers.</p><p>Before I go: Medium’s business model is designed to serve writers and readers — that’s it. It’s why we moved away from the race-to-the-bottom incentives of advertising, not to mention its distracting banners, junky pop-ups, sponsored recirc units, auto-play video, and data trackers that follow you around the internet. You won’t see any of that on Medium, and that’s because we don’t accept advertising. Instead, we have a metered paywall and a <a href="https://medium.com/membership">subscription service</a>, which costs $5 per month or $50 per year.</p><p>For those not up on the industry lingo, here’s how a metered paywall works: Everyone can read several paywalled stories for free every month; people who subscribe can read them all. (You can read an explanation from our founder and CEO Ev Williams on <a href="https://medium.com/@ev/the-rationalization-of-publishing-dc001d509de8">why we launched the paywall</a>, and you can get more detail about the model from <a href="https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a">Ev</a> and from a recent <a href="https://digiday.com/media/siobhan-oconnor-trying-make-medium-subscription-driven/">Digiday article</a> about our subscription business, and how it’s working.)</p><p>It is indeed working very well so far — which is great news for writers, because as our business grows, so does our investment in paying them well for their work. Our editorial budget increases every month as subscribers increase, which is happening quickly. We also spend a comparatively small amount of money syndicating stories from other publications that we present to our subscribers ad-free. (NB: Syndicated and commissioned stories do not earn money from the pool we use to pay Partner Program writers.) By the end of the year, we will have spent nearly $5 million in 2018 alone paying commissioned and Partner Program writers for their work.</p><p>We are always working — with writers and with each other — to make this place special.</p><p>Medium was built for writers, and we believe it remains the best place on the internet for writing and reading. Thank you for helping us make it great.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4c7844560887" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/how-medium-works-with-writers-4c7844560887">How Medium Works With Writers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been putting our <a href="https://blog.medium.com/the-medium-model-3ec28c6f603a">energy at Medium</a> into improving quality — hosting more thoughtful and carefully written content, and improving the reading experience. We want to eliminate distractions that get in the way of reading flow and reduce distortions that could undermine your trust in what you read on Medium.</p><p>To that end, we‘re adjusting our policies related to commercial content.</p><h3>Ads, Promotions, and Marketing</h3><p>First, we’ll be restricting some kinds of commercial activity that have been allowed in the past, such as sponsorships and links that are mainly promotional. Medium’s business has been ad-free for more than a year now. But some “ad-like” remnants that had value in the past are now less aligned with Medium’s model of using subscriptions and a metered paywall to provide the best quality user experience. This means eliminating certain features that are superficially free, but for which you pay with attention.</p><p>So, as of September 1, 2018, our policies will include:</p><ul><li><strong>First-party promotion is allowed.</strong> You can promote your own work or goods and services you provide, like a link to your website or your book. For posts or publications run by a company (like company blogs), you can promote goods or services provided by your company.</li><li><strong>Third-party advertising and sponsorships are not allowed. </strong>You may not advertise or promote third-party products, services, or brands through Medium posts, publications, or letters. This includes images that indicate brand sponsorship in a post or letter, or as part of a publication name or logo.</li><li><strong>Images functioning as third-party ads are not allowed.</strong> Inline images or embeds that link out and function as banner ads for third-party brands will no longer be allowed.</li><li><strong>You must disclose affiliate links or payment for a post. </strong>Affiliate links, such as link out to Amazon with your code, or any other link out where you will receive a commission or other value, are allowed in posts. But, you must disclose somewhere in the post that it includes affiliate links. If you have received payment, goods or services, or something else of value in exchange for writing a post, you must still disclose this fact in writing within your post (as <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking">FTC Rules and Guides</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4">Medium Rules</a> require).</li></ul><h3>Embedded Content</h3><p>Second, in preparing to comply with GDPR (the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation), it led us to step back, take a fresh look at our privacy practices, and renew our efforts to make Medium trustworthy. It raised questions about what types of data collection we should and should not allow through Medium. And in other cases, it led us to think about how to channel third-party data collection on Medium to make sure our users understand as clearly as possible what information about them is captured, by whom, where it winds up, and how it might be used.</p><p>As of September 1, 2018:</p><ul><li>Embeds that directly collect data through form fields will no longer be allowed.</li></ul><p>This includes embeds that facilitate the submission of email addresses and other personally identifying information through forms (such as Upscribe or Rabbut) and the submission of credit card information (such as Gumroad). We understand that this might make life harder for writers and publications who want to collect information directly from users. But, we believe this change is necessary to ensure that Medium readers know where their data is going and how it will be used.</p><p>Going forward, if you want to collect information from your users, you will need to link out from your post on Medium to a form hosted elsewhere that makes it clear to a user that they are no longer in the Medium network. We are working with Upscribe, Rabbut, and Gumroad so that their services function in line with these Medium policies.</p><p>We will continue to allow embeds that display content, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, GitHub, and others, as explained in our <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214981378-Embeds">Help Center</a>. Our <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9">Privacy Policy</a> discusses in more detail how we treat this type of embed.</p><p>Thank you. We’re grateful for your continued use of Medium and appreciate your working with us to make Medium a place for thoughtful, high-quality stories.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aeee8ef5dacf" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/ad-free-medium-aeee8ef5dacf">Ad-Free Medium</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><em>Now, writers in Medium’s Partner Program can earn money for stories they publish in publications and can share Friend Links that guarantee that fans and followers can view their work</em></h4><p>Today, we’re making two improvements to the <a href="https://medium.com/creators">Medium Partner Program</a> that have been among the most-requested features since we launched the program in 2017. Both changes are designed to reduce trade-offs for writers: Writers no longer have to choose between earning money and submitting their story to a publication, and writers no longer have to worry about their fans not being able to read their work because of our metered paywall.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5TBstrwpQEOfhcwnRSqA9A.png" /></figure><h4><strong>Partner Program stories can now appear in publications</strong></h4><p>First, we’ve removed the limitation that writers could not add Partner Program stories to publications on Medium. Now, all stories — whether in a publication or not — can be published behind the metered paywall and stand to earn money.</p><p>How do you do this? If you’re enrolled in the Partner Program, when editing your story, select that “Yes,” you would like to make your story eligible to earn money from the menu in the editor.</p><p>For more information — whether you’re an owner of a publication or a writer — read our <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005910834">FAQ</a>.</p><h4><strong>All Partner Program stories get a Friend Link that bypasses the paywall</strong></h4><p>We are also rolling out a new feature to all Partner Program writers: Friend Links will give anyone free access to your metered story, even if they’re not a subscribing <a href="http://medium.com/membership">Medium member</a> and have read their complimentary stories for the month. You can share a Friend Link directly or on any social media platform, and anyone who views your story through that link gets complete access with no restrictions. And, you’ll still get paid based on member engagement with your stories.</p><p>To get the Friend Link, simply go to the published story and click or tap “Share with friends” at the top left of the page. (This works for stories in publications, too — the link is at the top right of the page.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aV5oi8ormsvEX3nHKEBdhA.png" /></figure><p>Learn more about Friend Links in <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006543813">our FAQ</a>. Happy sharing!</p><h4><strong>About the Medium Partner Program</strong></h4><p>We launched the Medium Partner Program in October 2017 to reward writers for their work. Any writer can join the program, publish stories behind our metered paywall, and earn money based on the value their stories provide readers, not advertisers.

Anyone can write a piece on Medium and, as long as it’s not in violation of our <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4">rules</a>, have the potential to find an audience. We celebrate diverse voices and believe that good stories can come from anywhere.</p><p>We also care about quality. We want you to put your best work on Medium, and we regularly feature stories we think are great. To help you understand what we mean when we say “quality,” we’ve written up these guidelines. They are based on what we know works best for readers — which means they should work well for you, too.</p><ul><li>Write a clear headline. Readers have a split second to decide if they want to read your piece. Put a good, descriptive title and subtitle on your story. (Standard “headline” styling is title case for the headline and sentence case for the subtitle. This isn’t mandatory, but it’s ideal.)</li><li>Your story should contain original insight, ideas or perspectives. Don’t just aggregate the work of others, and don’t plagiarize.</li><li>Clean it up. We all make mistakes, but do look out for typos and janky formatting. Put care into your work.</li><li>Avoid CTAs. Readers tell us that they find repeated calls to action — to sign up for a newsletter, to clap — annoying. Consider eliminating CTAs altogether.</li><li>One of the things our readers like best about Medium is that it’s an ad-free zone.</li><li>Please don’t publish stories with the primary purpose of selling a product or a service. Readers can see through content marketing.</li><li>There are a lot of places on the Internet for clickbait. Medium doesn’t want to be one of them.</li><li>Put a nice image on your story — just make sure you’re not violating someone else’s copyright.</li><li>Finally, please don’t peddle pseudoscience or bad health advice. Life’s already too short to give people bad health advice.</li></ul><p>In short, do your best work. People like to read things that are just <em>good</em>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=386506ae62b9" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/best-practices-for-writing-on-medium-386506ae62b9">Best Practices for Writing On Medium</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Kara Brown and Manoush Zomorodi discuss the power of voice, their favorite books, and fancy pasta</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KEtjng5guCZGvjSNE3t7IA.png" /><figcaption>A conversation with Siobhan O’Connor, Manoush Zomordi, and Kara Brown. Illustrations: <a href="https://medium.com/u/e69f0c6dab7a">katie zhu</a></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, we released the <a href="https://medium.com/s/playback/roxane-gay-what-fullness-is-8efc5cab3daf">first episode</a> of our first podcast, Medium Playback. On each episode of the show, we invite a writer we love to the studio to perform a recent story they wrote for Medium (episode one features beloved author <a href="https://medium.com/u/d5f6a126e0de">Roxane Gay</a>) and then chat with us about it.</p><p>To make the show work, we were looking for hosts to introduce you to each episode’s guest and have a candid conversation with them about the story. We found that in <a href="https://medium.com/u/49262be5be06">Manoush Zomorodi</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/a8dfb70570b4">Kara Brown</a>. In addition to being experienced podcasters, they also are accomplished writers, which means they know how to get inside our guests’ heads.</p><p>Our VP of Editorial, <a href="https://medium.com/u/98ac79723788">Siobhan O&#39;Connor</a> sat down with Kara and Manoush to learn more about what makes them tick.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*a7T-QNuJyXLDjbRwyj9i9Q.png" /></figure><h4>Medium: What drew you to the project? Why Playback?</h4><p>Kara: There are so many stories out there that you rarely get to do a deep dive. In this age when you have all of this content and all this work being done, it’s nice to actually take a second to learn more about the things we enjoy.</p><h4>So it’s another chance — and a different way — to get a story in front of people.</h4><p>Manoush: <em>Playback</em> isn’t just to introduce people to new stories but also to experience it again in a different way. We take in so much information on screens all day long. So as a journalist who makes podcasts , I really appreciate the power of voice. To hear someone read their words. What do they emphasize? What emotions do they imbue in the words they’ve so carefully crafted? The way someone says something can really impart so much emotional information.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ga2cr_Q2lb7JKFEGXDYM7g.png" /></figure><h4>Can you think of an example from any of the episodes where, in hearing the story, there was an emotion or nuance that was unexpected?</h4><p>Kara: I find Roxane Gay’s voice so distinctive, so I like to hear everything she writes in her own voice anyway. But really hearing her go through that journey via her own reading made it even more powerful.</p><h4>I had a similar experience with Roxane’s episode. Somehow the frankness with which she writes feels less frank and more emotional when you hear it.</h4><p>Manoush: Baratunde Thurston’s a comedian, so when he says just one sentence you think, “Oh, I didn’t realize that was funny until I heard you say it.” In contrast, designer Mike Monteiro, who never has his voice out there, was equally powerful. He relaxed into the words he’d written and became passionate all over again about design and the ethical ways that we build our technology.</p><h4>What do you think you can do with a podcast that you can’t do with your own writing?</h4><p>Manoush: I do not feel as comfortable with longform writing. I wrote a book but it was painful. I really struggled. But I’ve been doing taped conversation and broadcast media for over 20 years and I just love it. I love that you can say a very short sentence but because of the way you say it, you can convey all kinds of meaning. Maybe that says I’m lazy. I’m not sure.</p><p>Kara: When I was at <em>Jezebel</em>, because of the nature of the site, people felt very connected to what I was writing. With podcasts it’s even more so and I’ve had to adjust. On <em>Keep It</em>, I’m in people’s ears when they’re driving to work or folding laundry. It’s very intimate. I was surprised by people’s reactions to it and how excited they were to meet me. At a live show people were running up to the stage, and I remember thinking, “Guys, calm down, it’s a podcast.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*UYZse7a8K6n-Dsug" /></figure><h4>Manoush, your work focuses on how technology impacts in our lives. I’m curious about your conversation with Baratunde about his data detox.</h4><p>Manoush: I had done a project in January 2017 called <em>The Privacy Paradox</em> , where we got 50,000 people to do a weeklong bootcamp to investigate where their personal data is. I put so much work into this and been shouting about this for so long, but I wasn’t sure if there would be any change.</p><p>When the Facebook story broke, this became a mainstream conversation in America. It was really a relief. So to hear Baratunde take all that has happened over the past year and to codify it into this beautiful long piece felt very satisfying.</p><p><strong>Kara, you wear many hats: you wrote for <em>Grown-ish</em>, Shondaland, and have a blog, </strong><a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fancypastabitch.com%2F"><strong>Fancy Pasta Bitch</strong></a><strong>. Tell us a bit more about that project.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*ZGBoOmuDhVXmbkeV" /></figure><p>Kara: The pasta blog is the silliest thing I do and it seems to elicit the greatest response. I bought a pasta machine around March of 2017, kind of in response to Trump being President. I wanted a hobby to take my mind off things. I made pasta one night and it was so good — I couldn’t believe I had made that. I thought, “This could be in a restaurant, I’m amazing. I’m a fancy pasta bitch!” I put it on Instagram and my friend Amina from the podcast <em>Call Your Girlfriend </em>messaged me, “You have to buy that URL.” And I had been drinking wine, so I went to Google and bought it for $15. I’m working on a new show called <em>In The Dark</em>. It’s a drama for the CW, so I’m trying to be a very dramatic person. So it’s nice to have the blog as an outlet for my dumbest jokes.</p><h4>Let’s do a lightning round. What’s the best book you’ve read so far this year?</h4><p>Kara: <em>The Truth about Animals</em> by Lucy Cooke. It’s all of this insane information about animals and really weird things that they do. We don’t know how eels have sex. It’s crazy.</p><p>Manoush: I just started reading my friend, Elizabeth Wallace’s new book, <em>The Ambition Decisions</em>, which isn’t even out yet. It’s about 40 women my age, my economic bracket, and what has happened to them in the last 20 years.</p><h4>What time of day do you do your best writing?</h4><p>Kara: My best writing unfortunately is around 11:30 p.m.</p><p>Manoush: In the late afternoon or evening. I wish it was at five in the morning but my brain doesn’t function.</p><h4>Favorite guilty pleasure TV show?</h4><p>Kara: Literally every <em>Real Housewives</em> franchise, although I don’t feel guilty about it.</p><p>Manoush: <em>High Maintenance</em>, also don’t feel guilty.</p><h4>What’s the most overrated aspect of summer?</h4><p>Kara: The beach in L.A. Give me a pool any day.</p><p>Manoush: Iced coffee. I think cafes are keeping old coffee around and icing it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XeRHPGmcawfOzWz9" /></figure><h4>Who on Twitter should we be following?</h4><p>Kara: <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwordscience">Samantha Irby</a> and a young writer, <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fgeekylonglegs">Sarah Hagi</a>. If I ever have a TV show I’m immediately hiring her.</p><p>Manoush: <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FNeinQuarterly">Nein Quarterly</a>. It’s German humor that’s not that funny and kind of negative.</p><h4>What song or album do you have on repeat?</h4><p>Kara: Cardi B’s new album. I have been a Cardi-Believer since the early days. I think everyone thought her album wouldn’t be good and it is and I’m very proud of her.</p><p>Manoush: <em>Why Do You Always Call Me When You’re High?</em> by the Arctic Monkeys. Because it reminds me of when I was 23.</p><h4>What’s your favorite word in the English language?</h4><p>Kara: “Persnickety.”</p><p>Manoush: My ten year old and I think “dormant” is so good because there’s a lot of promise there, it just hasn’t come yet.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*DcJ9y_Us5YeBuiJd" /></figure><p>Listen to <a href="https://medium.com/@playback">Medium Playback</a> on <a href="http://medium.com/playback">Medium</a>, <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmedium-playback%2Fid1394390142">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fmusic%2Flisten%3Fu%3D0%23%2Fps%2FIvnwjgyhf6wm55wnn6orrv2joke">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://blog.medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fshow%2F48D69V7ZL38UOCKe6Uepyv%3Fsi%3D-bDlvTHbRei87ja8rZI5jw">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://pca.st/c9nz">Pocket Casts</a>, or wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dfceca24042" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/we-have-a-podcast-meet-the-hosts-dfceca24042">We Have a Podcast!
