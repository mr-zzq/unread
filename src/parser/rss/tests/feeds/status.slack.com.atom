        <title>Incident: Errors when accessing Slack</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On February 21 between 7:00am PT to 9:20am PT, some users experienced connectivity issues with Slack.
            <br />
            <br />
The connectivity issue arose from a misconfiguration that was discovered by our engineers. At 8:45am PT a change in the configuration led to users being able to successfully connect to Slack again.
            <br />
            <br />
We’re hard at work on scoping preventative measures to ensure this doesn’t happen again in the future.

        <title>Incident: Delayed push notifications</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On February 21st at 4:22PM PST, we deployed a database change, which caused unexpected delays for processes such as notifications and link/image previews in Slack. The problem was identified and corrected, however a backlog of notifications and previews had formed in the meantime. We continued to monitor this backlog after the fix was implemented, and by 5:20PM PST, all functionality returned to normal.

        <title>Outage: Issues with mobile notifications for some Grid customers</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On February 15th at 12:30 PM PT, a database change was deployed to help us move to a new system. The change in systems resulted in push notifications not being delivered for some Grid customers. Between February 15th and 19th, we received reports of missing notifications from Grid customers which were attributed to a bug and further investigated. On February 19th, our team identified the root issue affecting Grid customers and reverted the deploy. By 6:30 PM PT the revert had been fully deployed and push notifications were working normally again.
            <br />
            <br />
We’re very sorry to those affected for the disruption. We’re investigating the root cause and making plans to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.

We identified that emails sent as early as 12:07pm PST may have been affected by this issue. Unfortunately, any emails sent via the integration during this time would not have been successful.

We do however have a workaround for the meantime. If you’re facing this problem, please try the following steps:
            <br />
            <br />
1. Open a mobile web browser and navigate to your workspace URL
            <br />
2. Tap 'Sign in with [your identity provider]'
            <br />
3. Enter your username and password, then sign in
            <br />
4. Once signed in, tap 'Open Slack' under 'Have the app already?' to launch your workspace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;10:25pm PST&lt;/small&gt; - We've identified that this affects some Android app users signing in with their identity providers on Grid. We're continuing to investigate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;9:22pm PST&lt;/small&gt; - Some customers may have trouble signing in to the Android app through their identity provider. We're very sorry for the disruption — we're on the case.&lt;/p&gt;

            <br />
            <br />
From 6:24PM to 6:46PM PT, some customers were not able to complete search requests in Slack.
            <br />

On Jan 14th at 12:46 PM PST, a code change was made to how Slackbot fetches Help Center articles. Customers with locales set to Japanese failed to get proper responses in their DM with Slackbot. Instead, they were sent the generic error "何を言われたかわかりませんでした。ごめんなさい" ("I'm sorry, I don't understand!")

        <title>Incident: Some workspaces are experiencing degraded service</title>
        <summary>Technical summary
            <br />
On December 18 at 8:55am PT we experienced an event that resulted in one of our databases being overloaded. This led to longer than usual response times for various actions in Slack, for a small subset of workspaces.
            <br />
            <br />
Our engineering team worked on implementing a fix, and functionality was restored to all workspaces by 10:05am PT.
            <br />
            <br />
We’re currently investigating preventive measures to ensure that this doesn’t happen again. If you’re still running into any issues, please reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.

        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
Earlier in the day, on December 10th, our Singapore calls server was temporarily taken out of action for some scheduled maintenance.
            <br />
            <br />
This exposed an existing bug in the calls API that had been re-routing calls originating from India and Japan to our Singapore calls server. With this server now offline, we started to receive reports from those regions of calls via mobile failing. At 9:19pm PT, we put a fix in place, and calls began to no longer fail on mobile devices.
            <br />
            <br />
Calls from these regions should now be working as expected. However, if you notice anything amiss, please contact us at feedback@slack.com.

        <title>Incident: Slow unfurls being experienced by all users.</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
On November 28th between 1:10pm (PT) and 4:33pm (PT), some customers experienced delays with parts of our service.

            <br />
An issue occurred at 1:10pm (PT) that triggered a high amount of API calls, creating a backlog in one of our job queues. This caused delays for some customers with features that rely on the job queue, including unfurls, Slackbot messages, and "All Threads" or "All Unreads".
            <br />

We worked through the backlog and deployed a fix which allowed the job queue to recover. The all clear was called at 1:38pm (PT).

An issue occurred at 1:10pm (PT) that triggered a high amount of API calls, creating a backlog in one of our job queues. This caused delays for some customers with features that rely on the job queue, including unfurls, Slackbot messages, and "All Threads" or "All Unreads".
            <br />
            <br />
We worked through the backlog and deployed a fix which allowed the job queue to recover. The all clear was called at 1:38pm (PT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;1:47pm PST&lt;/small&gt; - Unfurls are working properly once again! Please do let us know if you continue to see issues. Thank you for your patience while we sorted this out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;1:10pm PST&lt;/small&gt; - We're experiencing delays with unfurling, reaction emoji, and the /giphy command. We're investigating!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Incident: Trouble with the Google Calendar integration</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On November 27th at 3:07 pm PT, an update was made to the Google Drive integration that was not correctly processed. This prevented Google Calendar reminders from appearing correctly in channels for a subset of users.
            <br />
            <br />
After an investigation of the problem, our team deployed a fix at 11:41 pm PT, where normal functionality resumed at 12:14am PT. We'll continue to monitor the integration. If you continue to experience any issues please drop us a note at feedback@slack.com.

        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
At 1:05 pm PT, we made a webapp deploy that contained a change in the Platform API for `channels.join`.
            <br />
            <br />
Our Platform engineers noticed errors increasing for that particular endpoint and almost immediately, the culprit was identified.  At 2.54pm PT a forward fix was deployed.
            <br />
            <br />
The fix was immediate and the all clear was called at 3.10pm PT.

        <title>Incident: Some customers are unable to use search in their Administration pages</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On November 19th at approximately 07:46 AM PT our team internally identified a server that manages user-related information which was no longer serving requests in a timely manner. This affected a subset of users, and caused the Admin pages to not load properly. As a result, customers were not able to manage team members. We received the first reports from our customers at 08:54am PT, during this time our team was actively investigating the root cause of the issue.
            <br />
            <br />
A few contributing factors led to this incident, including a new feature that relied on the fetching and loading of user-groups and how it the functioned with the auto-complete modal. Our team worked to reduce the strain on the server which hosts user-related information. From there, we were able to deploy a fix, stabilizing the affected server at 04:07 PM PT. An official All-Clear was called at 04:45 PM PT on November 20th.
            <br />
            <br />
We’re sorry for the disruption to your work day. If you are still experiencing issues with managing team members, please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com

On November 13th, 2018 between 2:29 PM (PT) and 5:39 PM (PT) customers were unable to delete private channels if they were previously converted from public channels.

On November 7th at 12:17 AM (PT), we began experiencing issues that prevented some users in Europe from successfully connecting to their workspaces over the course of two days.
            <br />
            <br />
These connectivity problems were caused by unexpected resource limitations in two European data centers.
            <br />
            <br />
We have been working with our upstream service provider, AWS, to understand why this has been isolated to these two regions. In order to reduce disconnections, we have performed the following mitigation steps:
            <br />
            <br />
• We have deployed additional hardware into the pool to distribute connections across more machines.
            <br />
• We have converted one of these regions to work across multiple availability zones, which was done before the beginning of Europe's workday on November 9th.
            <br />
• AWS has put a mitigation in place for the load balancers.
            <br />
            <br />
We are deeply sorry for the disruption this has caused to your workdays. Please let us know if you are still experiencing any connectivity issues at feedback@slack.com.

        <title>Incident: Some people are unable to upload files to Slack.</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On November 6th 2018 at 10:38 am PT, we began to receive reports that file uploads were failing in Slack for all customers.
            <br />
            <br />
A recent change in our code had an adverse affect on file uploads, causing uploads to fail for 2 hours and 14 minutes. Once our engineering team discovered the issue, they reverted the code, and full functionality was restored for all customers by 12:55 pm PT. We called an All Clear at 1:21 pm PT.
            <br />
            <br />
If you are still experiencing trouble please reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.

        <title>Incident: Degraded functionality</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On October 22nd, at approximately 8:37 PM PT, we experienced a small network issue which caused one of our servers to disconnect. This affected the queue that hosts user actions and core functionalities, ranging from push notifications to managing team members.

            <br />
            <br />
At 12:28pm (PT) on October 22, 2018, a change was deployed that caused the hosts responsible for notifications, link unfurls and other tasks to fail. As this change propagated out, customers began experiencing degraded service in the form of late notifications and elevated API response times. After identifying the issue, we updated the affected hosts at 1:13pm (PT), allowing the system to recover and begin processing these tasks again normally. Service was fully restored by 2:40pm (PT).

        <title>Incident: Search returning partial results for some customers</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On October 22nd, 2018 between 8:38 AM (PT) and 9:31 AM (PT), 12% of customers experienced slow searches in Slack, and about 300 customers experienced failed searches.
            <br />
            <br />
This outcome was a result of a hardware failure. Once we inspected and removed the problematic hardware, normal search performance resumed for those users.
            <br />
            <br />
We are currently hard at work on scoping preventive measures to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.

        <title>Incident: Users experiencing slowness in the app</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary
            <br />
On October 18, 2018 at 4 PM PT, we identified a bug in how we were handling accounts being added to IDP groups. This resulted in the deactivation of some user accounts from their workspaces. This also removed their associated integrations, and archived many private channels.
            <br />
            <br />
We quickly reverted a code change, and began restoring the affected user accounts, private channels and integrations back to their previous states.
            <br />
            <br />
At 5:06 PM PT, we noticed that some servers were overloaded as a result of the restoration efforts we made. This meant that some customers were unable to connect to Slack. We monitored the situation as the server recovered. At 7:41 PM PT, our engineers confirmed functionality was restored for all customers.
            <br />
            <br />
On October 19 at 4:32 PM PT, we fully resolved the provisioning issue. Customers who were affected by this issue needed to reload Slack to regain access to their workspaces. We’re continuing to investigate the root cause of these issues to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.

        <title>Incident: Some folks are experiencing performance issues</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On October 17, 2018, for a few minutes starting at 11:28 AM PT, some customers were unable to connect to Slack. In addition, between 11:28 AM PT and 12:52 PM PT, some users experienced issues with notifications being delayed or not being received, files not successfully uploading, and messages failing to send. Our investigations determined this to be caused by a networking issue with one of our cloud providers. Functionality was fully recovered by a selective restart of the servers responsible for those tasks.

        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
            <br />
On October 13th between 5:43pm PT and 6:51pm PT a group of servers were failing to process some tasks. This impacted a number of features for all customers, including notifications, unfurls, custom responses and our Events API (which some apps and integrations rely on).
            <br />
            <br />
We identified issues with the health of some servers involved which were causing these processes to fail. At 6:40pm PT we restarted one of the servers and things started recovering. By 6:51pm PT, tasks that had queued up during the incident were cleared and service was back to normal.
            <br />
            <br />
We’re investigating the root cause, as well as making plans to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.

        <title>Incident: Some users are experiencing delayed notifications</title>
        <summary>On October 11th from 10:34am (PT) to 10:42am (PT), Slack experienced an error with one of our servers, which  resulted in degraded functionality for some customers.
            <br />
            <br />
We deployed new code to a server that didn't properly update. As a result, some product features were impacted. Most notably, a small number of mobile notifications were delayed up to 8 minutes.
            <br />
            <br />
We rolled back the deploy, and have since updated the server properly. You should no longer experience any delays receiving notifications. If you notice any further issues, please get in touch at feedback@slack.com.

A configuration change at 8:11pm PT caused any new app connections to fail. For connected users, the ability to view and upload files was also affected. This change was reverted at 8:22pm PT.

            <br />
We are currently hard at work on scoping preventive measures to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;8:22pm PDT&lt;/small&gt; - Everyone should be able to upload their files and access Slack once more. We're truly sorry for disrupting your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;8:11pm PDT&lt;/small&gt; - We are looking into reports of people having trouble accessing their workspaces and uploading files. Apologies for this disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Incident: Connectivity issues affecting workspaces in Europe</title>
        <summary>On October 1, from 9:22AM to 9:27AM (PT) and from 9:42AM to 9:47AM, some customers in Europe were unable to access Slack.
            <br />
            <br />
At 9:22AM, some customers in Europe weren’t able to connect to Slack due to trouble with servers in that region. We identified the problem, and re-routed customers to healthier servers. Everyone was able to reconnect by 9:27AM.
            <br />
            <br />
At 9:42AM, customers were disconnected again. With one more re-route, all customers were able to access Slack again by 9:47AM. At 10:05AM, we declared the issue resolved with everyone able to access Slack.

        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
On September 13th between 5:05pm and 7:20pm Pacific Time, some customers from Japan were unable to receive SMS authentication codes for Slack. This was due to a temporary issue with an upstream provider which has now been resolved. Everyone who was affected should once again be able to receive codes and sign in to Slack.

            <br />
In the meantime, you can talk to a workspace Admin or Owner to temporarily disable Two-Factor authentication. Alternatively, you could try using a 2FA authentication app — we have instructions on how to do so here: https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication#turn-on-2fa

        <title>Outage: Some people are having trouble connecting to Slack, we're working on it.</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary:
            <br />
From 11:15am to 11:28am PT, 100% of customers were not able to use Slack.
            <br />
            <br />
A deploy to our webapp to enable a feature for how we handle incoming connection requests referenced a function which wasn’t present in a specific file. This missing function caused all incoming requests to fail, returning connection errors to our users.
            <br />
            <br />
We rolled back that change for all users at 11:26am. Users were able to receive responses from our app again by 11:28am.

        <title>Outage: Connectivity issues</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary 18/09/07:
            <br />
At 4:38pm PT on September 6th, 2018, a change was deployed to Slack which prevented the majority of logged in users from viewing messages and stopped approximately 6.74% of users from logging in to Slack altogether.
            <br />
            <br />
The change that was added increased the load on one of our databases, which eventually failed. At 4:53pm PT we reverted the changes and within five minutes users were able to begin using Slack again. We were officially “all clear” by 5:01pm PT.

        <title>Incident: Some customers may experience trouble making Slack Calls from mobile</title>
        <summary>Technical Summary
            <br />
On August 28th, 2018 between 6:28pmPDT and 9:24pmPDT, Slack users in the APAC region were unable to initiate a Slack call on a mobile device.
            <br />

At 6:28pmPDT, we retained an out-of-date DNS record during a routine infrastructure change. This prevented Slack Calls from mobile devices in APAC from connecting with the up-to-date infastructure settings.
            <br />
            <br />
At 9:24pmPDT we manually removed the errant record and immediately resolved the issue. We’re currently working on preventative measures to avoid repeats of this scenario.

On August 28, 2018 between 10:15amPDT and 10:59amPDT, Slack experienced a 44-minute outage where all users were unable to establish new connections to the Slack service. Users who were already connected to the service were able to remain connected during this time.
